[SEP]

[CLS] well , what in fact was the content of that sms ? let ' ##s take a look via this footage , ha . i remember the sms was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leak ##age accident on the side road at the southeast corner of jing ##gua ##ng bridge at east third ring road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near chao ##yang road , jing ##gua ##ng bridge , and east third ring road , and requesting cars to make a det ##our . some car owners said that it was very good that the sms was sent . furthermore , there was one last sentence in that sms thanking citizens for their cooperation and support . ah , after the sms was sent , , i felt it seems to be the first time that beijing municipality , ah , used an sms to give notification at the time of a public emergency . i do n ##' ##t know , all of us are living in beijing , is this the first time , professor zhou ? yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 . uh ##- ##hu ##h . of course , in private life , people have used sms countless times to spread news . yes . other places in the country must have used this too . uh ##- ##hu ##h , uh ##- ##hu ##h . must have used this too . actually , i remember receiving an sms like this one last year before it snow ##ed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in beijing to a rather large extent . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , <span style="color:blue">it</span> did not give people such a special feeling as <span style="color:green">it</span> did this time . uh ##- ##hu ##h . ah , when an sms is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ? yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by beijing municipality , uh ##- ##hu ##h . an extremely good point that is worth ponder ##ing deeply , worthy innovation . uh ##- ##hu ##h . for instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone sms . in fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment .

[CLS] we usually make it sound like e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment is something una ##tta ##ina ##ble . yes , when we talked about e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment in the past , it seemed to be only done through the internet . right . it seemed that computers , ah , and the internet , ah , were an expression of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment , to let people find out information . well , presently in fact , e ##- ##go ##vern ##ments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic id ##s , and such as , these electronic signatures . these are quite sophisticated forms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . in particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone sms , are applied in e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment . hence , i think this is , a test of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment because , as i remember , during sar ##s in 2003 , people at that time criticized e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment during the spread of sar ##s , ah . uh ##- ##hu ##h . they said that e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment was very good but was not put into use . well , this time i think that a short sms like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment form . uh ##- ##hu ##h . yes . we drive often in beijing , ha , yang yang . if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there , what do <span style="color:blue">you</span> think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ? yes . ah , well , <span style="color:blue">i</span> think it would have been real paralysis . this is the most appropriate word to use . furthermore , <span style="color:blue">i</span> think that when sms was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our china very well . why is that so ? this is because , it should be said that china is the country with the highest sms usage . there are probably not as many chances to use <span style="color:blue">sms</span> in foreign countries compared with domestically , in china , ah . so , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement . yes , <span style="color:blue">i</span> noticed that many friends , around <span style="color:blue">me</span> received <span style="color:green">it</span> .

[SEP]

[CLS] so , how exactly did citizens react ? let ' ##s take a look at the reactions of citizens . - ##- an sms . i saw it was that jing ##gua ##ng bridge . hey , i say , this is quite good , quite good . have you received information like this before ? no , no . this was the first time . the first time ? yes , yes . well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ? quite fast . really quite fast , ah . so , <span style="color:blue">i</span> did not drive today . <span style="color:blue">i</span> set out a bit earlier and took the subway here . do <span style="color:blue">you</span> think that the response of the government was fast this time ? ah , the response was quite fast . in addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt . colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and sms . <span style="color:blue">i</span> think this plan was quite speedy . it seems that through this kind of sms , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha . well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression . let ' ##s find out the situation at that time through some footage . well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes . well , lots of barr ##ica ##de tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the jing ##gua ##ng bridge at east third ring road . all personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations . see , through this footage , we see , ah , this - ##- uh ##- ##hu ##h . okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o ##' ##cl ##ock . that means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre ##- ##da ##wn accident occurred . well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .

[CLS] well , ah , yang yang , you work at traffic radio station , ha , well , and we know that <span style="color:green">you all</span> gave an extensive live broadcast this morning . <span style="color:blue">a special program .</span> yes , <span style="color:blue">a special program on this traffic</span> . so , let ' ##s first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident . judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ? actually , concerning this , i think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in beijing . previously we had a stat ##istic , especially for the ring roads in beijing . that is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tail ##gate accident on a bridge such as the jing ##gua ##ng bridge of the third ring road , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jam ##s during these morning and evening peak periods . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road . well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods . well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jing ##gua ##ng bridge to chang ##hong bridge from the south all the way to guo ##ma ##o bridge , blocking the main and side roads . well , the situation would be un ##thi ##nka ##ble during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone . hence , at that time , before 6 ##: ##30 a . ##m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried . however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , the affected area was not as large as expected . moreover , some people made det ##ours once they received the news . [SEP]

[CLS] well , ah , yang yang , you work at traffic radio station , ha , well , and we know that <span style="color:green">you all</span> gave an extensive live broadcast this morning . a special program . yes , a special program on this traffic . so , let ' ##s first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident . judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ? actually , concerning this , i think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in beijing . previously we had a stat ##istic , especially for the ring roads in beijing . that is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tail ##gate accident on a bridge such as the jing ##gua ##ng bridge of the third ring road , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jam ##s during these morning and evening peak periods . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road . well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods . well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jing ##gua ##ng bridge to chang ##hong bridge from the south all the way to guo ##ma ##o bridge , blocking the main and side roads . well , the situation would be un ##thi ##nka ##ble during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone . hence , at that time , before 6 ##: ##30 a . ##m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried . however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , the affected area was not as large as expected . moreover , some people made det ##ours once they received the news . right . psychological ##ly , people felt quite relieved . because i know this situation . right , like those whom we interviewed just now . it was easy to handle once everyone understood . yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , i set out today before the incident , and i did not drive after i was informed . that person did not even drive . right . actually , in this aspect , i think that citizens were really quite cooperative . for instance , this evening , we , received an sms . a friend said , i work on the 12th floor of the china world trade center at the guo ##ma ##o bridge , ah . we were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route . later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the china world trade center . right . hey , he said this was quite a good idea . actually , i think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect . [SEP]

[CLS] ah , it can be said , ah , yang yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mental ##ity , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene . uh ##- ##hu ##h . right , right . , through <span style="color:green">your</span> listeners , what kind of feedback did <span style="color:green">you</span> find out from them ? actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone sms . since we know that jing ##gua ##ng bridge is located in the cb ##d district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of <span style="color:green">them</span> , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work . therefore , they sent sms saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus . well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning . we then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing . this shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind . i think that this mental ##ity in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mental ##ity that beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calm ##ness and maturity after having experienced frustration ##s . on the other hand , i think it can also fully show the level of people ' ##s satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident . that is , they think that the government has tried its best . well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts . uh ##- ##hu ##h . as such , in this regard , i think people ' ##s mental ##ity can become very calm . [SEP]

[CLS] well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ? yes . this is also - ##- it is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up . yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries . how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups . yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society . it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified . uh ##- ##hu ##h . how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ? well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another . for instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate . however , this time , through the execution of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role . hence , i think <span style="color:green">this</span> was also a kind of , er , trial of inter ##de ##par ##tment ##al cooperation mechanisms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . <span style="color:blue">it</span> was a very successful , er , response . i think many good things can be sum ##med up from this . yes . yang yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people ' ##s lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was re ##media ##l work carried out ? for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently . er , heating pipes were indeed damaged . well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70 ##, ##00 ##0 square meters of beijing .

[CLS] well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ? yes . this is also - ##- it is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up . yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries . how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups . yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society . it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified . uh ##- ##hu ##h . how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ? well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another . for instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate . however , this time , through the execution of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role . hence , i think <span style="color:green">this</span> was also a kind of , er , trial of inter ##de ##par ##tment ##al cooperation mechanisms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it was a very successful , er , response . i think many good things can be sum ##med up from this . yes . yang yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people ' ##s lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was re ##media ##l work carried out ? for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently . er , heating pipes were indeed damaged . well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70 ##, ##00 ##0 square meters of beijing . well , , in this regard , the chao ##yang district government did a very good job . after it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heat ##ers to residents in more than 200 households within this area . it should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday . well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly . hence , over here , i think the municipal government , ah , including sub ##- ##dis ##tric ##t offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households . i think it was done in a very humanitarian manner . uh ##- ##hu ##h . uh ##- ##hu ##h . [SEP]

[CLS] um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worth ##while for us to learn ? i think , in comparison to china , we should say that urban ##ization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread . their level of development is more advanced than ours . although the scale of our urban ##ization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , i think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries . for instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries . with a background of liberal ##ization , market ##ization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ? how can a safe , assured system be established ? well , we need to learn and manage this . uh ##- ##hu ##h . for instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast . however , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility . well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances . well , for some of our emergency con ##ting ##ency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency con ##ting ##ency plans withstand these tests ? we know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people ' ##s governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency con ##ting ##ency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test . well , how will <span style="color:blue">they</span> undergo testing ? <span style="color:blue">these</span> also include some of our command and policy - making systems . so , with the growth of urban ##ization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , i think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems . that is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities . how can we institutional ##ize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?

[CLS] but first judy miller and the new york times finally go public on the front page this morning with their nearly six thousand word account of the cia leak investigation . in a separate first person account miller confirmed that she told the grand jury that <span style="color:blue">sc ##oot ##er libby dick cheney ' ##s top aide</span> discussed with <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">her</span></span> as many as three times the role of valerie pl ##ame as a cia employee . this says the bush administration was angry about her husband joe wilson ' ##s role in criticizing president bush on whether saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction . the conclusion by a team of times reporters . the times incurred millions of dollars in legal fees in <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">miss miller ' ##s</span></span> case . it limited its own ability to cover aspects of one of the biggest scandals of the day . even as the paper asked for the public ' ##s support it was unable to answer <span style="color:blue">its</span> questions . among the journalist ##ic revelations ##, miller released from jail last month says she pushed for a story on the outing of valerie pl ##ame back in two thousand three . she never wrote one . but her former boss says no way . that never happened . and the times was so conflict ##ed in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about <span style="color:blue">libby</span> and pulled their punches in other ways .

i do n ##' ##t know . ah eh i do n ##' ##t know . well nobody knows . that ' ##s the point . aria ##nna huffington i used to cover the justice department . not everybody who ' ##s under investigation winds up getting indicted . ah but you certainly and you ' ##re uh on a blog so maybe it ' ##s a different standard have speculated about ro ##ve ' ##s fate as well . well not just ro ##ve though . what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that fitzgerald is after the whole iraq white house group the group that uh in cheney ' ##s office with libby and ro ##ve and mary mata ##lin and condo ##lee ##zza rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the american public based on lies . i mean that is really the web . but it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the miller story , that uh fitzgerald is after cheney even in some of the questioning eh of miller . <span style="color:green">i</span> think those were fairly routine questions about . you have judy miller there . you ask about cheney . . he was being thorough . i think we ' ##re over ##thi ##nk ##ing this whole thing . karl ro ##ve and this speculation business you know . frank se ##s ##no . pat fitzgerald . it ' ##s very easy to sit here and say oh we should never spec ##ulate in journalism . it ' ##s ir ##res ##pon ##sible journalism . it ' ##s really how you spec ##ulate not that you spec ##ulate . the fact of the matter is that karl ro ##ve has been to the grand jury four times . the fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in washington and believe me they ' ##re not all journalists who are spec ##ulating what if the guy gets indicted . it would be ir ##res ##pon ##sible i think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town . and there are plenty of republicans mostly republicans who are worried about this . alright i want to turn now to uh president bush ' ##s uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with us troops in iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be . let ' ##s take a look at the actual footage . and in your interactions with the iraqi civilians in ti ##kr ##it saddam ' ##s hometown how are they reacting to this political process ? sir in the north central area of iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent . can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in ti ##kr ##it ? sir in north central iraq voter regis ##- / ##- are you stunned ? are you stunned ? shocked . i ca n ##' ##t believe it . they re ##hear ##sed it . they re ##hear ##sed it . they re ##hear ##sed it . yeah you know something ? uh i remember a long time ago michael dea ##ver the ultimate image mei ##ster for ronald reagan said my job is to light the president well and for everything i do to put the president in a good light . now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see . and what the problem this now creates for the white house is { ##is ##} it plays into the credibility issue that the president has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a re ##hear ##sed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of iraq the whole bit . but the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote . i mean anybody in television will tell you that ' ##s complicated business . you have satellite delay . you have a half a dozen people sitting there . who ' ##s going to speak when . you do n ##' ##t want awkward silence ##s . you ' ##re going to walk through it . so that it happened does n ##' ##t surprise me . that it hurts the president yeah that ' ##s inevitable too . aria ##nna huffington does the staging here surprise you at all ? well it ' ##s not the question of sur ##pis ##ing me howie . it ' ##s the fact that we are talking about war . this is not just any photo opportunity . of course that ' ##s part and parcel of the presidency . but we ' ##re talking about a war in which almost two thousand young americans have died . and we are also using soldiers as props . yes it is shocking . and i think keith ol ##berman ##n did a phenomena ##l job at exposing this on ms ##nbc . alright . and i think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing . and we ' ##ll have to leave it there . last word . aria ##nna huffington lucy dal ##gli ##sh in minneapolis frank se ##s ##no thanks so very much for joining us .

[CLS] welcome back to the second half of reliable sources . our new time for those of you just turning in is ten am eastern seven on the west coast . and we ' ##ll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week . the iraq story which the media has placed on the back burn ##er in recent months is sim ##mering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted . but are journalists getting the real story there ? to help us sc ##rut ##ini ##ze the coverage i sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the new york times three time pulitzer winner tom friedman and the author most recently of the world is flat . tom friedman welcome . good to be here howie . thank <span style="color:green">you</span> . the other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the new york times you would ' ##ve led the paper with the news of recent days that a sunni suicide bomber on rama ##dan had attacked a shi ##ite mosque . now in reality the world that you do n ##' ##t rule new york times washington post made <span style="color:green">that</span> part of a larger story on iraq . uh nobody put <span style="color:green">it</span> on the front page . bad news judgement ? uh i think so howie . i ' ##m not here to make a news point though . i ' ##m really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism . i ' ##m a firm believer . how we ever going to win this war ? we ' ##re never going to win it by way of american intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist . we get lucky every once in a while . but there ' ##s only { ##one ##? ##} way we win this war howie is it takes a village . it only happens when the sunni muslim world basically turns people in and when the sunni muslim world restrain ##s <span style="color:green">their</span> own . and what was so shocking to me about this story a sunni jihad ##i suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of rama ##dan . what that tells you is that there ' ##s no controlling moral authority today in the sunni muslim world . well what is the bigger story ? and that is a huge story . i think it should have been a big story .

[CLS] welcome back to the second half of reliable sources . our new time for those of you just turning in is ten am eastern seven on the west coast . and we ' ##ll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week . the iraq story which the media has placed on the back burn ##er in recent months is sim ##mering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted . but are journalists getting the real story there ? to help us sc ##rut ##ini ##ze the coverage i sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the new york times three time pulitzer winner tom friedman and the author most recently of the world is flat . tom friedman welcome . good to be here howie . thank <span style="color:green">you</span> . the other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the new york times you would ' ##ve led the paper with the news of recent days that a sunni suicide bomber on rama ##dan had attacked a shi ##ite mosque . now in reality the world that you do n ##' ##t rule new york times washington post made <span style="color:green">that</span> part of a larger story on iraq . uh nobody put <span style="color:green">it</span> on the front page . bad news judgement ? uh i think so howie . i ' ##m not here to make a news point though . i ' ##m really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism . i ' ##m a firm believer . how we ever going to win this war ? we ' ##re never going to win it by way of american intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist . we get lucky every once in a while . but there ' ##s only { ##one ##? ##} way we win this war howie is it takes a village . it only happens when the sunni muslim world basically turns people in and when the sunni muslim world restrain ##s their own . and what was so shocking to me about this story a sunni jihad ##i suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of rama ##dan . what that tells you is that there ' ##s no controlling moral authority today in the sunni muslim world . well what is the bigger story ? and that is a huge story . i think it should have been a big story . why was n ##' ##t / ##- is it because of iraq fatigue ? um . i think it is yeah . think it ' ##s / ##- are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed . and it does n ##' ##t rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page ? right . yeah and i think that ' ##s right . there is iraq fatigue . and there ' ##s so much fatigue that we do n ##' ##t sit back and say wait a minute . what happened today ? a sunni muslim fundamental ##ist went into a mosque on the first day of rama ##dan their ho ##liest day . and no one says boo . this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately i do n ##' ##t know abused the ko ##ran people riot ##ed in pakistan . yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being def ##iled . and i think it is a measure of how much we ' ##ve kind of lost been numb ##ed by all of this that we do n ##' ##t sit back and say wow wait a minute . that really crosses the line . and we have to call them on it even if they do n ##' ##t . you ' ##re recently back from iraq . and you write about driving in from kuwait . you were guarded by the us navy . and yet it was kind of a harrow ##ing experience . why so ? um you know the south of iraq which is where i was the area around . this is the safe part . right exactly . i was in the safe district . i was guarded uh by the british royal marines actually because unfortunately they ' ##ve had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs . and it ' ##s part of the general continuing ins ##ec ##urity of iraq that um i ' ##m afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning . and it ' ##s been i ' ##ve always felt the ac ##hill ##e ' ##s heel . you know my criticism of the bush administration as you know we ' ##ve talked about this before is not that this war is not important . i believe it is important much more important than i think the left has ever fully recognized . but it ' ##s so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge . and on that trip you put on body armor . their rifles were out . yeah . um how does that affect your perception as a journalist ? you ' ##re there . you ' ##re being protected . and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there . well i ' ##ll tell you what ' ##s really frustrating from a journalist ' ##s point of view as one who have lived in beirut for nearly five years covered that war . when i worked in lebanon you could go anywhere on that story . you could cross lines . journalists worked for the most part until the very end with terry anderson the kidnapping ##s targets . therefore by the end of the lebanon story i thought the best journalists there knew more than the lebanese . i always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the lebanese something they did n ##' ##t know because you were moving around so much . what ' ##s so frustrating about the iraq story howie no one has a bird ' ##s eye view . i care passionate ##ly about this story . i ' ##m so interested in it . but because of the sec ##urt ##iy situation you ca n ##' ##t move around with the freedom you want . and the brave reporters who are there every day do n ##' ##t have that freedom of movement either . and therefore it ' ##s limited . [SEP]

[CLS] and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some bias ##es in the media . there ' ##s a lot of good things going on in iraq . there ' ##s a lot of progress being made we ' ##re not seeing reported by the press . do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there ? no because i do n ##' ##t have a bird ' ##s eye view . i wish i could say . i wish i could be so sure . but general casey does n ##' ##t have a bird ' ##s eye view . and that ' ##s why we get surprises in iraq . uh <span style="color:green">that</span> ' ##s why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out . and maybe you know we ' ##re going to see more sur ##pis ##es in the coming future there . but because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n ##' ##t have that bird ' ##s eye view . and as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story i find that really fr ##ust ##ra ##- / ##- i can not report it the way i ' ##d love to . so i ' ##ve been there five times . but it ' ##s ep ##iso ##dic . it ' ##s here . it ' ##s there . it ' ##s never really putting your arms around the story . pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you ' ##d have to say that the iraq story has been overshadowed by katrina by rita by tom delay by harriet mi ##ers by valerie pl ##ame and now by this pakistan earthquake . um inevitable with a war that drag ##s on and on . and these are all also important stories obviously . but uh do you feel it ' ##s getting the attention that it should ? yeah . no because to me this is the whole ball ##game of the bush administration . katrina and rita they ' ##ll come and go . but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there . if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there . um if it does n ##' ##t happen i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure . so everything rides on <span style="color:green">this</span> not just for the administration though but for the american people . [SEP]

[CLS] so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the american people . these are huge stakes involved . and so i do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s gotten the attention it ' ##s deserved . and going back again to one of your iraq col ##lum ##ns uh you observed the iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shoulder ##ing the burden of this conflict . the slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the us and british advisors out tomorrow the whole iraqi navy would collapse . that ' ##s a pretty pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic assessment and clearly at odds with what the white house and the defense department say every day . . not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration . so you ' ##re saying there ' ##s a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record . you quoted one us senior official and what the president of the united states and the vice president and the secretary of defense are saying to reporters every day . are we calling them on that ? right i do n ##' ##t think enough because there ' ##s been a lot of happy talk around this <span style="color:blue">howie</span> basically . and a lot of numbers are thrown out . eighty thousand this week we ' ##ve got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week . here ' ##s what you learn when you go to iraq . where you have an iraqi commander who ' ##s a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit . and where you do n ##' ##t have that commander you do n ##' ##t have a unit . so the numbers the macro numbers do n ##' ##t mean anything . so i went down to see the navy there . the navy of iraq has a terrific commander . so the people around him they ' ##ll follow him into battle . but you take that one guy out there ' ##s no iraqi navy . and it ' ##s true of units all over the country . that ' ##s really the key . you say that you are angry uh that bush has fought the war as though <span style="color:green">it</span> would be easy . [SEP]

[CLS] and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some bias ##es in the media . there ' ##s a lot of good things going on in iraq . there ' ##s a lot of progress being made we ' ##re not seeing reported by the press . do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there ? no because i do n ##' ##t have a bird ' ##s eye view . i wish i could say . i wish i could be so sure . but general casey does n ##' ##t have a bird ' ##s eye view . and that ' ##s why we get surprises in iraq . uh <span style="color:green">that</span> ' ##s why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out . and maybe you know we ' ##re going to see more sur ##pis ##es in the coming future there . but because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n ##' ##t have that bird ' ##s eye view . and as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story i find that really fr ##ust ##ra ##- / ##- i can not report it the way i ' ##d love to . so i ' ##ve been there five times . but it ' ##s ep ##iso ##dic . it ' ##s here . it ' ##s there . it ' ##s never really putting your arms around the story . pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you ' ##d have to say that the iraq story has been overshadowed by katrina by rita by tom delay by harriet mi ##ers by valerie pl ##ame and now by this pakistan earthquake . um inevitable with a war that drag ##s on and on . and these are all also important stories obviously . but uh do you feel it ' ##s getting the attention that it should ? yeah . no because to me this is the whole ball ##game of the bush administration . katrina and rita they ' ##ll come and go . but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there . if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there . um if it does n ##' ##t happen i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure . so everything rides on <span style="color:green">this</span> not just for the administration though but for the american people . these are huge stakes involved . and so i do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s gotten the attention it ' ##s deserved . and going back again to one of your iraq col ##lum ##ns uh you observed the iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shoulder ##ing the burden of this conflict . the slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the us and british advisors out tomorrow the whole iraqi navy would collapse . that ' ##s a pretty pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic assessment and clearly at odds with what the white house and the defense department say every day . . not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration . so you ' ##re saying there ' ##s a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record . you quoted one us senior official and what the president of the united states and the vice president and the secretary of defense are saying to reporters every day . are we calling them on that ? right i do n ##' ##t think enough because there ' ##s been a lot of happy talk around this howie basically . and a lot of numbers are thrown out . eighty thousand this week we ' ##ve got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week . here ' ##s what you learn when you go to iraq . where you have an iraqi commander who ' ##s a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit . and where you do n ##' ##t have that commander you do n ##' ##t have a unit . so the numbers the macro numbers do n ##' ##t mean anything . so i went down to see the navy there . the navy of iraq has a terrific commander . so the people around him they ' ##ll follow him into battle . but you take that one guy out there ' ##s no iraqi navy . and it ' ##s true of units all over the country . that ' ##s really the key . you say that you are angry uh that bush has fought the war as though it would be easy . are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so ? yes . absolutely because i believe this is important . i believe that something very big is at stake . we ' ##re dealing with a muslim arab civilization right now that ' ##s that ' ##s in decline , that ' ##s heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and i believe dangerous for the stability of the world . there ' ##s something really important here at stake . and what makes me so angry at the bush administration is not that they did n ##' ##t frame the stakes . it is important . but they never never appreciated how difficult it was . they never prepared the army or the american people for how difficult it was . i mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in pakistan a region you ' ##re familiar with . um clearly it ' ##s become a pretty big story . but for the first couple days i noticed it was n ##' ##t that much of a television story . and the reason was no pictures no video . no yes . um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it ' ##s in a remote part of the world ? uh western ##ers are more interested in new orleans than in pakistan ? i think all of the above . we ' ##re so numb ##ed also after katrina and rita . and now another earthquake . . it ' ##s just become uh one natural disaster after another . to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it ' ##s almost hard for a journalist to process . right . and it was remote . and people are exhausted i think both viewers and reporters .

[CLS] that does n ##' ##t work for japan . it does n ##' ##t work with south korea . and frankly it does n ##' ##t work with the chinese . so i said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this chinese delegation going to . and chris hill our ambassador was in china a few days ago . he made the point and secretary rice made the point yesterday to the chinese foreign minister , <span style="color:green">we</span> want to see china use its influence . <span style="color:green">we</span> want to see china push forward and ask the north koreans to meet these commitments that they ' ##ve made to all of us . speaker newt gin ##gr ##ich the former speaker republican weighed in on this debate in this way . he offered this . the time to replace the state department ' ##s failed <span style="color:green">north korea</span> strategy of talk forever , act never has come . for thirteen years the united states has talked loudly about a <span style="color:green">north korea</span> nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat . for thirteen years the north korean dictatorship has lied and hu ##nk ##ered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles . the strategy of talking has failed . america ' ##s actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal total ##itarian dictatorship about which we know little . <span style="color:green">it</span> is acting in defiance of all <span style="color:green">its</span> own international commitments . but the time for talk is over . either <span style="color:green">they</span> di ##sman ##tle the missile . or we the united states should di ##sman ##tle it . well uh with all due respect to speaker gin ##gr ##ich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success . and you never want to di ##sa ##vo ##w a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion . and as i said before we are not alone in this endeavor . we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure . i will say this what the north koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system . you ' ##ve seen very strong statements by the japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm . so obviously we ' ##re going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the north koreans on their obligations to pressure them to come back to the talks but also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in asia . and i think you ' ##ll see us move ahead smart ##ly in that direction as well .

oh i do n ##' ##t think it was coincide ##ntal . you know it ' ##s a very unreliable and unpredictable regime . the last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make . but they certainly chose <span style="color:green">that</span> to get our attention and that of the international community . uh but what they ' ##ve got to realize is there is no magic bullet here . they ca n ##' ##t just think that they can sit down with the united states alone . that does n ##' ##t work for japan . it does n ##' ##t work with south korea . and frankly it does n ##' ##t work with the chinese . so i said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this chinese delegation going to . and chris hill our ambassador was in china a few days ago . he made the point and secretary rice made the point yesterday to the chinese foreign minister , we want to see china use its influence . we want to see china push forward and ask the north koreans to meet these commitments that they ' ##ve made to all of us . speaker newt gin ##gr ##ich the former speaker republican weighed in on this debate in this way . he offered this . the time to replace the state department ' ##s failed north korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come . for thirteen years the united states has talked loudly about a north korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat . for thirteen years the north korean dictatorship has lied and hu ##nk ##ered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles . the strategy of talking has failed . america ' ##s actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal total ##itarian dictatorship about which we know little . it is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments . but the time for talk is over . either they di ##sman ##tle the missile . or we the united states should di ##sman ##tle it . well uh with all due respect to speaker gin ##gr ##ich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success . and you never want to di ##sa ##vo ##w a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion . and as i said before we are not alone in this endeavor . we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure . i will say this what the north koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system . you ' ##ve seen very strong statements by the japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm . so obviously we ' ##re going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the north koreans on their obligations to pressure them to come back to the talks but also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in asia . and i think you ' ##ll see us move ahead smart ##ly in that direction as well . uh mister ambassador many critics will say the six years george bush has been president north korea ' ##s program has developed rather dramatically that the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n ##' ##t worked .

[CLS] coming next the view of three former clinton administration officials who spent years dealing with the north korea problem former assistant secretary of defense ashton carter chief state department ne ##go ##tia ##tor now at the georgetown university robert gall ##ucci and former us ambassador to the un now governor of new mexico bill richardson . they are all right here next only on meet the press . and we are back . welcome all . governor richardson should the united states negotiate directly one on one with north korea ? yes it should . uh our policy so far is not working . uh what you have is north korea has quad ##rup ##led its enriched pluto ##nium since two thousand and two . uh the six party talks are going nowhere . we should talk directly to the north koreans to discuss what is next . they need to di ##sman ##tle their nuclear weapons . they need to destroy their missile capability . the only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of christopher hill . he is a competent diplomat . uh the successes we ' ##ve had with the north koreans have been through direct engagement when i got some pilots out of north korea when bob gall ##ucci negotiated the agreed framework . secretary al ##bright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles . what north korea is seeing right now is iran getting a nuclear reactor . they see iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives . on the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the united states . but also they want to see an effort by the united states to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve . i do n ##' ##t believe they do . they are a des ##olate isolated regime . but right now our policy is not working . it makes sense to talk directly with north korea . but would n ##' ##t <span style="color:green">the world</span> then say oh i see . you test a missile on the fourth of july . you get the us attention . and you bring <span style="color:green">them</span> to the bargaining table . our policy right now does not work . look where we are right now . uh asia is des ##ta ##bil ##ized . we are trying to outs ##our ##ce our foreign policy to china . i believe china is not necessarily interested in helping us on north korea . they do n ##' ##t want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country . i believe that china is a competitor . they control a lot of our debt . right now we do not have leverage over china . the best effort in my judgment is face to face talks . hard negotiating . get that agreement that was uh signed in september that north korea has not ab ##ided to . a time table for north korea to di ##sman ##tle its nuclear weapons . efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n ##' ##t attack north korea . they get economic assistance . but our objective should be firm . to get them to di ##sman ##tle their nuclear weapons . the best way to do it is face to face talks . if the president now changed his course wo n ##' ##t the headlines be bush blink ##s ? no . i believe the headlines would be bush deals realistic ##ally with north korea . he reverse ##s a policy that is not working . ambassador gall ##ucci do you agree with that ? just about entirely . uh i have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something nick pounded on . uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in asia engaged that ' ##s / ##- it ' ##s true . it is their problem as well as ours . but the fact is it has n ##' ##t worked . and to make the form more important than a substance to care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of pluto ##nium is absurd in my view . you ' ##d have some conditions . you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you ' ##d negotiate face to face . now that they ' ##ve launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one ? this is kind of a rule i think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head . and i think a decent interval now and some work at the united nations is the appropriate thing to do . but i think we ' ##re taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now . what should the administration do ? it needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table . and the fact that you may get a headline like the president is rev ##ers ##ing course as indeed we have in the case of iran that ' ##s not so bad if you find you ' ##re on the wrong course . and we have been .

[CLS] ashton carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between north korea and the us ? no i actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the north koreans if others are at the table . let ' ##s go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place . the reason to have everybody at the table with the north koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with north korea diplomacy has to have a coe ##rc ##ive dimension . and <span style="color:green">we</span> do n ##' ##t trade with north korea . <span style="color:green">we</span> do n ##' ##t recognize north korea diplomatic ##ally . uh there ' ##s almost nothing <span style="color:green">we</span> can do short of military action to apply pressure to north korea . <span style="color:green">we</span> ' ##re capable of military action . and it ' ##s important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy . but the real lever ##s on kim jong - il are the chinese and the south koreans . it is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically . but makes sense to have them at the table . the six party talks i totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quad ##rup ##ling of the amount of pluto ##nium as ambassador richardson said um in north korean hands and now missile launches . so they ' ##ve been running wild for three years or so . um the reason for that / ##- there ' ##s a lot of blame to go around . you have to start with the north koreans and their own intra ##ns ##igen ##ce . the chinese and the south koreans have not done everything that they should . uh they ' ##ve shown the carrot ##s . they ' ##ve been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wi ##eld . i think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the north koreans . and our government i believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps . one camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with north korea . but there ' ##s another camp uh in <span style="color:green">this country</span> and i think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the north koreans is a fools game or is even im ##moral because of the nature of the regime . i do n ##' ##t agree with that view because i think it ' ##s more im ##moral to let north korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with north korea .

[SEP]

[CLS] in the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inc ##ul ##cation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet . farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school . originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education . however , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more . during this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children . this pair of una ##vo ##ida ##ble contradiction ##s has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious . you have seen many kinds of left - behind children . was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ? , um , there was a child in ni ##ng ##xia whose name was yao zheng ##ang . this child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school . what impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents . he felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back . he said that he was sick one time . his father worked in guy ##uan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home . after his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away . after he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">his</span></span> back and carry him to the town to see a doctor . he just carried him like that without saying a word . when the doctor in the town took a look and told <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">him</span></span> that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county . when <span style="color:green">yao zheng ##ang</span> told us what happened , <span style="color:green">he</span> said , " <span style="color:green">my</span> father had never bought <span style="color:green">me</span> so many ta ##sty foods before . on that day , he bought <span style="color:green">me</span> a lot of ta ##sty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . " i thought about this at that time . [SEP]

[CLS] in the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inc ##ul ##cation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet . farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school . originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education . however , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more . during this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children . this pair of una ##vo ##ida ##ble contradiction ##s has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious . you have seen many kinds of left - behind children . was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ? , um , there was a child in ni ##ng ##xia whose name was yao zheng ##ang . this child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school . what impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents . he felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back . he said that he was sick one time . his father worked in guy ##uan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home . after his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away . after he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on <span style="color:green">his</span> back and carry him to the town to see a doctor . he just carried him like that without saying a word . when the doctor in the town took a look and told <span style="color:green">him</span> that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county . when <span style="color:green">yao zheng ##ang</span> told us what happened , <span style="color:green">he</span> said , " <span style="color:green">my</span> father had never bought <span style="color:green">me</span> so many ta ##sty foods before . on that day , he bought <span style="color:green">me</span> a lot of ta ##sty food while we were in the county , but <span style="color:green">he</span> did not eat any <span style="color:green">himself</span> . " i thought about this at that time . after i heard this incident , i particularly understood what was in the mind of <span style="color:green">yao zheng ##ang ' ##s</span> father . he might have felt especially guilty toward his child . what he felt was that " i go out to work and leave my child home .

" <span style="color:green">he</span> would say , " no problem . you work hard and get a better grade next time , " when i had low grades . if he could receive many , such encouragement ##s , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes . he does not want to go to school now . however , in his example , i could imagine what went through his father ' ##s mind at that time . i think that he felt very guilty toward his child . therefore , i can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative . they are forced into making such decisions . um , there was also this child . there was a child , a girl in xi ##xia ##ng county , sha ##an ##xi province . um , when i asked , " what do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " she did not answer . she went home to get a small box . there was a small finger inside the box . this was a very terrifying incident . what was the small finger all about ? what happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her . they had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay . when she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened . her grandparents said , " we ca n ##' ##t help . we ca n ##' ##t keep an eye on her all the time . " , before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar . he had told her not to do that before . however , i said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control . that was why she turned this way .

our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone . however , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so . what could they talk about in three minutes ? i think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes . of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations . what did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ? what touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children ' ##s conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned . as for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school . whether they were good and how their school ##work was . second , it was whether they obeyed their cu ##sto ##dian ##s and what they ate and things like that . uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange . we know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange . however , the parents may not have realized this . for instance , the child has stopped talking . he stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind . the parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately . of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ? in many cases , it was because they worried about the charge . , many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone . however , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home . it was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors . second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call . some children told me , " i secretly called my parents when my cu ##sto ##dian ##s were not home .

[CLS] do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ? um , um , we conducted a survey on this question . we were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home . how could that be possible ? how could that be possible ? we interviewed some left - behind children , <span style="color:green">their</span> cu ##sto ##dian ##s , and the people who work in the city . why would n ##' ##t the children know what they did ? first , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city . however , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coal ##mine ##s , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs . thus , i believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of <span style="color:green">their</span> job . why do they do that ? it is because they are afraid that their children will worry . second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly loft ##y image in the children ' ##s mind . maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of <span style="color:green">their</span> job or tell them what <span style="color:green">they</span> do . they , do not want to destroy the loft ##y image of themselves in the child ' ##s mind . at noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home . jiang bei ##wen has to make lunch for himself . this happens to him very often . he could look after himself since he was nine . what work are you going to do today , other than cooking ? uh , i will do the dishes after i finish eating . if it is sunday when i am free , i will , also do some farm work . what kind of work ? uh , i will ho ##e the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , i will help do some work . do you still remember your mother ' ##s cooking ? uh huh , i do .

[CLS] then , are these children willing to live with <span style="color:green">their parents</span> ? or go to the city with them ? in regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them . however , <span style="color:green">51 percent of <span style="color:green">the children we surveyed</span></span> were unwilling to go to the city with <span style="color:green">their</span> parents , go to the city , to live in the city . however , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of <span style="color:green">the children</span> did not want to go to the city . we also asked them why they did not want to go to the city . this was also very surprising to us . they said that the city is another world and they were especially worried . they were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to ass ##imi ##late into the schools and things like that . second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city . their parents have to send money home , among other things . if they go live with <span style="color:green">them</span> , they will add more burden ##s to their parents . if we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this . as for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear . as for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ? i believe when <span style="color:green">parents</span> make this decision , <span style="color:green">their</span> main consideration is not willing or unwilling . all parents , i can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with <span style="color:green"><span style="color:green">their</span> children</span> . however , with the reality that <span style="color:green">they</span> have to face , i believe that <span style="color:green">they</span> can not solve this problem . of course , we know what the reality is . first , <span style="color:green">their</span> families are rather poor to begin with . only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city . they have to make money to support the family . they will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city . nonetheless , i believe there are also many other reasons . they also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city . they have to find a place to live . all these are problems that they need to resolve . the problems they face are too many . if the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high . since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or <span style="color:green">their</span> psychological need . many parents are unable to bring their children with them . what would you tell your parents if you could see them now ? i want to tell them that i miss them very much . [SEP]

[CLS] judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non ##- ##le ##ft - behind children ? it is hard to tell from the surface . why is it so ? for these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city . for example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already . in this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect . however , many schools and cu ##sto ##dian ##s reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn . they had very strange um , um , temperament ##s . they did not like to speak . there was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school . um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father . he was very good at school . however , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination . after that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed . um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange . um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him . they said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him . um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city . however , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development . this situation indeed exists . after all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete . i believe love is especially important . children need love from the time they are small . we have to understand our chinese saying , " the child is father to the man . " what it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect <span style="color:blue">their</span> entire life . only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future . this is the case . [SEP]

[CLS] this is the case . therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychological ##ly , they do not have family love . um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home . perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love . under this situation , i believe , i am not sure , um , i am unwilling to imagine what mental ##ity and character these children will develop when they grow up . will they believe there is love in society or not ? will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it . they have never completely experienced it . thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , i think this is , something that i do not want to imagine . despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , <span style="color:green">they</span> do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that <span style="color:green">they</span> require . according to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life . 58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy . are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by <span style="color:green">themselves</span> ? do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ? they thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face . they were condemned to this reality . no doubt , i think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration . why do n ##' ##t they ? i believe people are all the same . if they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood . they can not consider the deeper issue of children ' ##s safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed . for example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in sha ##an ##xi province .

[CLS] back to the middle east tonight . the truce broker ##ed by president clinton between israelis and palestinians allegedly is in ta ##tters . palestinians now talking about a battle for independence . israel says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether . nine palestinians were killed today . more than 70 people have been wounded , mostly palestinians , but also several israeli soldiers . abc ' ##s bob wood ##ruff is in the palestinian territories tonight . violence ripped through almost every major palestinian town today . the worst was in na ##bl ##us . four palestinians were shot and killed . in rama ##llah , thousands of palestinians rushed the israeli checkpoint , then faced down israeli guns . from he ##bron to gaza , the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them . as is so often the case , much of the trouble started with funeral ##s that escalated into fury . most significant , demonstrators who had been throwing stones this week , today turned to gasoline bombs . israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones . this was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely . tonight on israeli television , prime minister barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n ##' ##t stop , barak ' ##s spokesman said israel will continue to use live ammunition . they leave no other way for us but to respond with fire , we ' ##ll have to do this . palestinian leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire , <span style="color:green">they</span> want <span style="color:green">their</span> own country . we are under occupation and sub ##ju ##gation . the question should be what the ho ##s ##ni mu ##bara ##k are they still doing there eight years after the peace process began . it is one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the st ##oning and shooting had stopped . it certainly has not stopped . not yet . bob wood ##ruff , abc news , rama ##llah .

[CLS] in what may have been a ripple effect of the middle east crisis , an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a us navy destroyer in the yemen ##i port of aden . american investigators are going to the scene but in washington at the white house , the pentagon and the state department , us officials are already expressing suspicions that today ' ##s explosion was an act of terrorism . the world ' ##s clark boyd reports . the blast , which occurred just after noon local time in yemen , ripped a 20 x 40 foot gas ##h in the uss cole , a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in aden to ref ##uel before joining the carrier george washington in the persian gulf . speaking at the cole ' ##s home base in norfolk , virginia , admiral john foley said that the navy is investigating the incident . i do n ##' ##t know whether it was terrorism or not . it was an act of certainly a severe bell ##iger ##ence but we do n ##' ##t know the source , nor can i comment any further on that . but in washington , pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists . the officials said that reports from the scene , including one from an army officer working in aden harbor , suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the cole dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast . many , including retired admiral eugene carroll , are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned . that craft that approached the cole is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but <span style="color:green">they</span> would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that <span style="color:green">they</span> did to the cole and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together . while both the pentagon and the justice department today dispatched teams of experts to yemen to investigate the explosion , secretary of state madeleine al ##bright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions . still , she promised that the united states would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast , a sentiment echoed later in the day by president clinton . if , as it now appears , this was an act of terrorism , it was a des ##pic ##able and coward ##ly act . we will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable . if their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the middle east , they will fail utterly . for some terrorism experts today ' ##s attack , which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between palestinians and israelis in the middle east , has an ee ##rily familiar ring to it . bruce hoffman is the director of the rand corporation ' ##s washington office . we have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the middle east often em ##bro ##il the united states . one only has to recall the bombing of the us marine barracks in lebanon in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when israel was involving suitable fe ##rm ##ent at that point in lebanon now with the palestinians , where the united states was also attempting actively to provide some stab ##ili ##zing influence and unfortunately and tragic ##ally got caught up in the mae ##ls ##trom and that seems to be the sal ##ient fact of this attack . and if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists , hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend . maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare . that being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern . we have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the arabian peninsula . so , i think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs ' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today . on yemen ##i tv today the country ' ##s president expressed his heart - felt condo ##lence ##s to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits mohammed al - q ##ad ##hi , editor of the yemen observer newspaper in the capital san ##a , anti ##- ##ame ##rica ##n sentiment has been running high in yemen because of events in the middle east . the people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as arabs , as human beings , that what is happening in palestine is not humanitarian . regarding the united states ' attitude in this regard , we find that the united states until now are supporting israel . the people here feel that united states should do something . with tensions running high throughout the middle east , today ' ##s incident off the coast of yemen serves as a warning . us armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come . for the world this is clark boyd .

[CLS] he had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him , he takes to the road in the tradition of old chinese poets and records what he sees , what he hears , the stories that he is told . the book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorge ##s through which he walks , the mountains that he climbs , indeed the book is called soul mountain , the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul , his individual soul , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the communist chinese authorities , the social realism that the cad ##res would have him write in . not only can this fellow write , he can paint too , ca n ##' ##t he ? he is best known among his neighbors in paris as a painter . he has had more than 30 one - man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright . <span style="color:green">i</span> think he has published about 18 plays now and he writes his plays in french . just one last thing quoting him and i wonder if you could respond to this , christopher , he said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to the nobel prize committee , he said , ` ##` i do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history , what i want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual .

" the taiwan firms here now are powerful enough to get two or three members of the legislative yuan to represent their interests , " holds one senior reporter . although tb ##ad ' ##s ye ##h believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good , he does acknowledge the pre ##car ##ious ##ness of their position in hostile territory . taiwan business interests can not put down their guard . because of taiwan ' ##s experience with rapid modernization , many cc ##p cad ##res have sought employment with taiwanese firms , hoping to learn from the masters . at the first opportunity , however , they leave to set up shop for themselves . " the student then challenges the master , " explains sylvia yang , detailing how <span style="color:green">these mainland ups ##tar ##ts</span> go on to compete with the very taiwan firms that taught <span style="color:green">them</span> all <span style="color:green">they</span> know . this scenario should be familiar to taiwanese . " it happens in taiwan too . " apart from keeping up <span style="color:green">their</span> guard , it is even more important that taiwan firms raise their productivity and technological level . " many manufacturers , even those in mainland china , will not survive , " says ye ##h . taiwan firms find it difficult to adjust to the instability of the mainland ' ##s investment environment , as well as the laws there that seemingly change overnight . the year before last the mainland announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be tax ##ed at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported . " when i went to beijing to negotiate , " recalls ye ##h , " i asked cad ##res in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry . profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % . how can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ? " in june of last year the prc authorities announced the " document # 35 " rules . these stipulated that companies would be given grades according to the quantity of their exports and their records of breaking customs regulations . those merit ##ing only a b would have to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of their raw material imports . this terrified taiwan firms in dong ##gua ##n . according to <span style="color:green">tb ##ad ' ##s</span> statistics , 75 % of the taiwanese firms were given bs . the announcement caused quite a stir , but its effect on taiwanese investment is as yet unclear . in august of last year , as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling , 12 taiwan business people in dong ##gua ##n were detained . the charges ran the ga ##mut from not filling out proper forms to purchasing ph ##ony export contracts and trying to pass them off to customs . seven business people were arrested and charged with smuggling and are still in jail . " i ' ##m constantly thinking about them . i ' ##m med ##itating and have gone vegetarian , but i ' ##m still not at peace , " ye ##h says . on the mainland , the highest penalty for smuggling is death . " last year the mainland sent nine customs officers to the firing squad , " notes ye ##h . the fate of these taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on the mainland ' ##s political climate .

' ##' in addition , ms ##. con ##sol ##o says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one - quarter lower than landlord ##s ' initial asking price . a handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th street and madison and fifth avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . and , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . but on average , manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say . that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retail ##ing . ` ##` as businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrink ##s , ' ##' says edward a ##. friedman , senior vice president of helm ##sley spear inc . he says financial problems pl ##ag ##uing electronics , fur and furniture companies - ##- key categories in the local retail economy - ##- have further def ##lated the market . hardest hit are what he calls ` ##` secondary ' ##' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . in these locations , mr ##. friedman says , ` ##` retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined .

[CLS] when justice william brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the supreme court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous ann ##iver ##sari ##es of his tenure . for the first time , the 83 - year - old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court ' ##s majority . this role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , justices th ##urg ##ood marshall , harry black ##mun and john stevens . but are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ? every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustration ##s that go with it , but in different ways . justices brennan and stevens appear philosophical about it ; justices <span style="color:green">marshall</span> and black ##mun appear fighting mad . the four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to critic ##ize the court ' ##s conservative drift . but always , in years past , they have buck ##ed the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to ek ##e out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases . now , however , as the court ' ##s new five - member conservative majority continues to solid ##ify , victories for the liberals are rare . the change is most dramatic for justice brennan , the last survivor of the mid ##- ##19 ##60 ##s liberal majority under chief justice earl warren . in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the warren court ' ##s power , justice brennan cast only 25 dissent ##ing votes in 555 cases decided by the court . last term alone he cast 52 dissent ##ing votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory . but justice brennan fore ##sa ##w his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissent ##s in a 1985 speech . ` ##` each time the court rev ##isi ##ts an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to rec ##ons ##ider the fundamental questions and to re ##thi ##nk the result , ' ##' he said . moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . he has said that he now knows how justice john harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissent ##er from the warren court ' ##s opinions . associates of 81 - year - old justice marshall say he was ` ##` depressed ' ##' about the court ' ##s direction last spring , but is fei ##sty about his role and determined to speak out against the court ' ##s cut ##backs in civil rights . ` ##` we could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but i ' ##m not going to do it , ' ##' he said in a speech last month . he , like justice brennan , considers dissent ##s highly important for the future , a point that has n ##' ##t escaped legal scholars . harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a ` ##` generation - skipping ' ##' flavor to current dissent ##s . the dissent ##ers in the warren court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short - term , suggesting that the court ' ##s direction might change soon . ` ##` brennan and marshall are speaking in their dissent ##s to a more distant future , ' ##' he says . justice black ##mun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems fei ##sty about his new role . associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curt ##ail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , roe vs ##. wade . friends and associates who saw justice black ##mun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years . and his outlook improved after successful cat ##ara ##ct surgery in august . but his level of frustration showed in a recent , imp ##ass ##ioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago . he concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late martin luther king ' ##s famous ` ##` i have a dream ' ##' speech from the 1963 march on washington . justice stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissent ##ers about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others . if the role these four dissent ##ers are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court watch ##ers say . ` ##` the dissent ##ers of the warren court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , ' ##' says prof ##. a ##. ##e ##. dick howard of the university of virginia law school , ` ##` but the dissent ##ers today are defending a legacy that they created .

fe ##rran ##ti is ge ##c ' ##s main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts , and its purchase by ge ##c may height ##en british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country ' ##s defense industry . a consortium bid , however , would dim ##ini ##sh ge ##c ' ##s direct role in fe ##rran ##ti and might consequently app ##ease ministry officials . a british aerospace spoke ##sw ##oman appeared un ##per ##tur ##bed by the prospect of a fight with ge ##c for fe ##rran ##ti : ` ##` competition is the name of the game , ' ##' she said . at least one potential ge ##c partner , mat ##ra , insists it is n ##' ##t interested in fe ##rran ##ti . ` ##` we have nothing to say about this affair , which does n ##' ##t concern us , ' ##' a mat ##ra official said sunday . the missile venture , the british aerospace spoke ##sw ##oman said , is a needed response to the ` ##` new environment ' ##' in defense contracting . for both thomson and british aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries ; and middle east sales , a traditional main ##sta ##y for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . the venture ' ##s importance for thomson is great . thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans . the european defense industry is con ##sol ##ida ##ting ; for instance , west germany ' ##s siemens ag recently joined ge ##c in a takeover of britain ' ##s pl ##ess ##ey co ##. , and dai ##mler - benz agreed to buy mess ##ers ##ch ##mit ##t - bo ##el ##kow b ##loh ##m g ##. ##m ##. ##b . h . in missiles , thomson is already overshadowed by british aerospace and by its home rival , france ' ##s aero ##sp ##ati ##ale s ##. ##a ##. ; to better compete , thomson officials say , they need a partnership . to justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture , thomson would make a cash payment to british aerospace . annual revenue of british aerospace ' ##s missile business is about # 950 million , a thomson spokesman said . british aerospace ' ##s chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of rap ##ier surface - to - air missiles . thomson missile products , with about half british aerospace ' ##s annual revenue , include the cr ##ota ##le surface - to - air missile family .

[CLS] just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves . does this signal another black monday is coming ? or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like oct ##. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ? here ' ##s what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday ' ##s action , what happens next and what investors should do . joseph granville . ` ##` i ' ##m the only one who said there would be an october massacre , all through late august and september , ' ##' says mr ##. granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well - known newsletter writer . ` ##` everyone will tell you that <span style="color:green">this time</span> is different from 1987 , ' ##' he says . ` ##` well , in some ways <span style="color:green">it</span> is different , but technically it is just the same . if you ' ##re a technician , you obey the signals . right now they ' ##re telling me to get the hell out and stay out . i see no major support until 220 ##0 . i see a possibility of going to 220 ##0 this month . ' ##' mr ##. granville says he would n ##' ##t even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52 - week low ##s ; about 100 stocks hit new low ##s friday . ` ##` most people , ' ##' he says , ` ##` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ' ##' elaine ga ##rza ##relli . a quantitative analyst with shear ##son lehman hutton inc ##. , ms ##. ga ##rza ##relli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . friday ' ##s big drop , she says , ` ##` was not a crash . this was an october massacre ' ##' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . so she thinks the damage will be short - lived and contained . ` ##` those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10 ##% ##- ##12 % down , ' ##' she says . ` ##` this is exactly the same thing , as far as i ' ##m concerned . ' ##' thus , she says , if the dow jones industrial average dropped below 245 ##0 , ` ##` it would just be a flu ##ke . my advice is to buy . ' ##' as she calculate ##s it , the average stock now sells for about 12 ##. ##5 times companies ' earnings . she says that ratio could climb to 14 ##. ##5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of ` ##` fair value . ' ##' ned davis . friday ' ##s fall marks the start of a bear market , says mr ##. davis , president of ned davis research inc . but mr ##. davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987 - style crash . ` ##` there was a unique combination in 1987 , ' ##' he says . ` ##` margin debt was at a record high . there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . the main thing was portfolio insurance , ' ##' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . ` ##` a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject ' ##' to it . in 1987 , such selling contributed to a snow ##ball effect . today could even be an up day , mr ##. davis says , if major broker ##age firms agree to refrain from program trading . over the next several months , though , he says things look bad . ` ##` i think the market will be heading down into november , ' ##' he says . ` ##` we will probably have a year - end rally , and then go down again . sort of a two - step bear market . ' ##' he expects the down ##turn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around 2000 sometime next year . ` ##` that would be a normal bear market , ' ##' he says . ` ##` i guess that ' ##s my forecast . ' ##' leon g ##. cooper ##man . ` ##` i do n ##' ##t think the market is going through another october ' ##8 ##7 . i do n ##' ##t think that ' ##s the case at all , ' ##' says mr ##. cooper ##man , a partner at goldman , sachs & co ##. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management . mr ##. cooper ##man sees this as a good time to pick up bargain ##s , but he does n ##' ##t think there ' ##s any need to rush . ` ##` i expect the market to open weaker monday , but then it should find some stability . ' ##' he tick ##s off several major differences between now and two years ago . unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . and unlike 1987 , the economy does n ##' ##t appear to be in any danger of over ##hea ##ting . but the economy ' ##s slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits ` ##` is n ##' ##t good , ' ##' he says . ` ##` so it ' ##s a very mixed bag . ' ##' thus , he concludes , ` ##` this is not a good environment to be fully invested ' ##' in stocks . ` ##` if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolio ##s , i would not do any buying . but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio , so i would look to do some modest buying ' ##' on behalf of clients . ` ##` we ' ##re going to look for some of the better - known companies that got clock ##ed ' ##' friday . john kenneth gal ##bra ##ith . ` ##` this is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for rec ##urrent insanity , ' ##' says mr ##. gal ##bra ##ith , an economist . ` ##` i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , ' ##' he says . ` ##` the explosion of junk bonds and takeover ##s has lodged a lot of ins ##ecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeover ##s or feared takeover ##s with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ' ##' nevertheless , he says a depression does n ##' ##t appear likely . ` ##` there is more res ##ili ##ency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , ' ##' he says . ` ##` it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the thirties - ##- much as the financial community and the government may try . ' ##' mario gabe ##lli . new york money manager mario gabe ##lli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeover ##s are n ##' ##t totally gone . ` ##` companies are still going to buy companies around the world , ' ##' he says . examples are ` ##` ford looking at jaguar , bells ##outh looking at lin broadcasting . ' ##' these sorts of takeover ##s do n ##' ##t require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so mr ##. gabe ##lli figures they will continue . ` ##` the market was up 35 % since - ##lc ##b ##- president - ##rc ##b ##- bush took office , ' ##' mr ##. gabe ##lli says , so a correction was to be expected . he thinks another crash is ` ##` unlikely , ' ##' and says he was ` ##` ni ##bbling at ' ##' selected stocks during friday ' ##s plunge . ` ##` stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity - ##lc ##b ##- this - ##rc ##b ##- week for guys like me , ' ##' he says . jim rogers . ` ##` it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally prick ##ed the balloon , ' ##' says mr ##. rogers , a professor of finance at columbia university and former co ##- ##mana ##ger of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , quantum fund . he sees ` ##` economic problems , financial problems ' ##' ahead for the u ##. ##s ##. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . ` ##` friday you could n ##' ##t sell dollars , ' ##' he says . dealers ` ##` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ' ##' if the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflation ##ary pressures in the u ##. ##s ##. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much . mr ##. rogers wo n ##' ##t decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go . he recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks - ##- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . frank cu ##rz ##io . many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . queens newsletter writer francis x ##. cu ##rz ##io actually did it : he stated in writing in september 1987 that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . mr ##. cu ##rz ##io says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board . if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , ` ##` that could quiet things down . ' ##' if not , ` ##` we could go to 220 ##0 very soon . ' ##' frank w ##. terri ##zzi . stock prices ` ##` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , ' ##' says mr ##. terri ##zzi , president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc ##. in cincinnati . renaissance , which manages about $ 1 ##. ##8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalent ##s , primarily u ##. ##s ##. treasury bills . ` ##` t - bills probably are the right place to be , ' ##' he says .

' ##' it defended appropriate constitutional safeguard ##s and practical common sense . the problem , which the journal so right ##ly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of mr ##. lan ##tos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a quasi ##- ##par ##lia ##ment ##ary / judicial body . - ##lr ##b ##- of course , we ' ##ve also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . - ##rr ##b ##- the system is the problem , not an individual member . individuals can always have their hands slapped . it ' ##s when such slapping does n ##' ##t occur that we ' ##ve got trouble . i do not by any means defend hu ##d management . but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any inc ##omp ##ete ##ncy - ##lr ##b ##- and , yes , maybe criminal ##ity - ##rr ##b ##- within hu ##d could possibly generate . the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when ` ##` tail gunner joe ' ##' mccarthy did his work . raymond weber par ##si ##ppa ##ny , n ##. ##j . i disagree with the statement by mr ##. lan ##tos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former hu ##d officials who assert their fifth amendment privilege against self - inc ##rim ##ination in congressional hearings . the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person ` ##` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ' ##' this privilege against self - inc ##rim ##ination pre ##cl ##udes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant ' ##s failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to ` ##` take the fifth . ' ##' the privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that ` ##` the fifth amendment does not pre ##cl ##ude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ' ##' baxter v ##. palm ##ing ##iano , 425 u ##. ##s ##. 308 - ##lr ##b ##- 1976 - ##rr ##b ##- . thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the fifth , and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and just ##if ##iable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one ' ##s testimony harm ##s him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutional ##ly used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . thus , when mr ##. pierce asserted the fifth in a non ##cr ##imi ##nal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good - faith , just ##if ##iable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . the subcommittee , congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to con ##cu ##r with mr ##. pierce ' ##s own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . drawing the adverse inference in a non ##cr ##imi ##nal congressional hearing does not off ##end the fifth amendment shield against self - inc ##rim ##ination . clark s ##. spa ##ls ##bury jr . este ##s park , col ##o .

' ##' some of the teachers of the law heard what jesus said . they said to themselves , ` ##` what an insult to god for this man to say that ! ' ##' jesus knew what they were thinking . so he said , ` ##` why are you thinking such evil thoughts ? the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins . but how can i prove this to you ? maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say , ' your sins are forgiven . ' there ' ##s no proof that it really happened . but what if i say to the man , ' stand up and walk ' ? then you will be able to see that i really have this power . ' ##' so jesus said to the paralyzed man , ` ##` stand up . take your mat and go home . ' ##' the man stood up and went home . the people saw this and they were amazed . they praised god for letting someone have such power . when jesus was leaving , he saw a man named matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes . jesus said to <span style="color:green">him</span> , ` ##` follow me . ' ##' so <span style="color:blue">he</span> got up and followed jesus . [SEP]

[CLS] jesus ate dinner at matthew ' ##s house . many tax collectors and others with bad reputation ##s came and ate with him and his followers . the ph ##aris ##ees saw that jesus was eating with these people . they asked his followers , ` ##` why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinn ##ers ? ' ##' jesus heard them say this . so he said to them , ` ##` it is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy . you need to go and learn what this scripture means : ' i do n ##' ##t want animal sacrifices ; i want you to show kindness to people . ' i did not come to invite good people . i came to invite sinn ##ers . ' ##' then the followers of john came to jesus and said , ` ##` we and the ph ##aris ##ees fast often , but your followers do n ##' ##t ever fast . why ? ' ##' jesus answered , ` ##` at a wedding the friends of the bride ##gr ##oom are not sad while he is with them . they can not fast then . but the time will come when the bride ##gr ##oom will be taken from them . then they will fast . ` ##` when someone se ##ws a patch over a hole in an old coat , they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been sh ##run ##k . if they do , the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat . then the hole will be worse . also , people never pour new wine into old wines ##kins . they would break , the wine would spill out , and the wines ##kins would be ruined . people always put new wine into new wines ##kins , which wo n ##' ##t break , and the wine stays good . ' ##' while jesus was still talking , a leader of the synagogue came to him . the leader bowed down before him and said , ` ##` my daughter has just died . but if you will come and touch her with your hand , she will live again . ' ##' so jesus and his followers went with the man . on the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . she came close behind jesus and touched the bottom of <span style="color:blue">his coat</span> . she was thinking , ` ##` if i can touch <span style="color:blue">his coat</span> , i will be healed . ' ##' jesus turned and saw the woman . [SEP]

[CLS] the news about this spread all around the area . as jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him . they said loudly , ` ##` show kindness to us , son of david . ' ##' jesus went inside , and the blind men went with him . he asked them , ` ##` do you believe that i am able to make you see again ? ' ##' they answered , ` ##` yes , lord , we believe . ' ##' then jesus touched their eyes and said , ` ##` you believe that i can make you see again , so it will happen . ' ##' then the men were able to see . jesus gave them a strong warning . he said , ` ##` do n ##' ##t tell anyone about this . ' ##' but they left and spread the news about jesus all around that area . as these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to jesus . this man could not talk because he had a demon inside him . jesus forced the demon out , and the man was able to talk . the people were amazed and said , ` ##` we have never seen anything like this in israel . ' ##' but the ph ##aris ##ees said , ` ##` the ruler of demons is the one that gives <span style="color:green">him</span> power to force demons out . ' ##' jesus traveled through all the towns and villages . he taught in their synagogue ##s and told people the good news about god ' ##s kingdom . he healed all kinds of diseases and sickness ##es . jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless - ##- like sheep without a shepherd to lead <span style="color:blue">them</span> . jesus said to his followers , ` ##` there is <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">such a big harvest of people to bring in</span></span> . but there are only a few workers to help harvest them . god owns the harvest . ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest .

[CLS] after jesus said all these things , he left galilee . he went into the area of jude ##a on the other side of the jordan river . many people followed him . jesus healed the sick people there . some ph ##aris ##ees came to jesus . they tried to make him say something wrong . they asked him , ` ##` is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ' ##' jesus answered , ` ##` surely you have read this in the scriptures : when god made the world , ' he made people male and female . ' and god said , ' that is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . and the two people will become one . ' so they are no longer two , but one . god has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ' ##' the ph ##aris ##ees asked , ` ##` then why did moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ' ##' jesus answered , ` ##` moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept god ' ##s teaching . but divorce was not allowed in the beginning . i tell you that whoever divorce ##s his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ' ##' <span style="color:blue">the followers</span> said to jesus , ` ##` if that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry .

' ##' so the apostles went out . they traveled through all the towns . they told the good news and healed people everywhere . hero ##d the ruler heard about all these things that were happening . he was confused because some people said , ` ##` john the ba ##pt ##izer has risen from death . ' ##' others said , ` ##` elijah has come to us . ' ##' and some others said , ` ##` one of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ' ##' hero ##d said , ` ##` i cut off john ' ##s head . so who is this man i hear these things about ? ' ##' hero ##d continued trying to see jesus . when the apostles came back , they told jesus what they had done on their trip . then <span style="color:green">he</span> took them away to a town called beth ##sai ##da . there , he and his apostles could be alone together . but the people learned where jesus went and followed him . he welcomed them and talked with them about god ' ##s kingdom . he healed the people who were sick . late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to jesus and said , ` ##` no one lives in this place . send the people away . they need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . ' ##' but jesus said to the apostles , ` ##` you give them something to eat . ' ##' they said , ` ##` we have only five lo ##aves of bread and two fish . do <span style="color:green">you</span> want us to go buy food for all these people ? ' ##' there are too many ! - ##lr ##b ##- there were <span style="color:green">about 5000 men</span> there . - ##rr ##b ##- jesus said to his followers , ` ##` tell <span style="color:green">the people</span> to sit in groups of about 50 people . ' ##' so the followers did this and <span style="color:green">everyone</span> sat down . then jesus took the five lo ##aves of bread and two fish . he looked up into the sky and thanked god for the food . then he broke it into pieces , which he gave to the followers to give to the people . they all ate until they were full . and there was a lot of food left . twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten . one time jesus was praying alone . his followers came together there , and he asked them , ` ##` who do the people say i am ? ' ##' they answered , ` ##` some people say you are john the ba ##pt ##izer . others say you are elijah . and some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . ' ##' then jesus said to his followers , ` ##` and who do you say i am ? ' ##' peter answered , ` ##` you are the christ from god . ' ##' jesus warned them not to tell anyone . then jesus said , ` ##` the son of man must suffer many things . he will be rejected by the older jewish leaders , the leading priests , and teachers of the law . and he will be killed . but after three days he will be raised from death . ' ##' jesus continued to say to all of them , ` ##` any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want . you must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me . any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . but you who give up your life for me will save it . it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost . do n ##' ##t be ashamed of me and my teaching . if that happens , i will be ashamed of you when i come with my divine great ##ness and that of the father and the holy angels . believe me when i say that some of you people standing here will see god ' ##s kingdom before you die . ' ##' about eight days after jesus said these things , he took peter , john , and james and went up on a mountain to pray . while jesus was praying , his face began to change . his clothes became shining white . then two men were there , talking with him . they were moses and elijah . they also looked bright and glorious . they were talking with jesus about his death that would happen in jerusalem . peter and the others were asleep . but they woke up and saw the glory of jesus . they also saw the two men who were standing with him . when moses and elijah were leaving , peter said , ` ##` master , it is good that we are here . we will put three tents here - ##- one for you , one for moses , and one for elijah . ' ##' - ##lr ##b ##- he did not know what he was saying . - ##rr ##b ##- while peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them . peter , john , and james were afraid when the cloud covered them . a voice came from the cloud and said , ` ##` this is my son . he is the one i have chosen . obey him . ' ##' when the voice stopped , only jesus was there . peter , john , and james said nothing . and for a long time after that , they told no one about what they had seen . [SEP]

' ##' jesus answered , ` ##` you people today have no faith . your lives are all wrong . how long must i be with you and be patient with you ? ' ##' then jesus said to the man , ` ##` bring your son here . ' ##' while the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground . the boy lost control of himself . but jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit . then the boy was healed , and jesus gave him back to his father . <span style="color:blue">all the people</span> were amazed at the great power of god . <span style="color:blue">the people</span> were still amazed about all the things jesus did . he said to his followers , ` ##` do n ##' ##t forget what i will tell you now : the son of man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ' ##' but the followers did not understand what he meant . the meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it . but they were afraid to ask jesus about what he said . jesus ' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest . jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him . then he said to the followers , ` ##` whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me . and anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . the one among you who is the most humble - ##- this is the one who is great .

' ##' he answered , ` ##` the man they call jesus made <span style="color:green">some mud</span> and put <span style="color:green">it</span> on my eyes . then he told me to go to si ##lo ##am and wash . so i went there and washed . and then i could see . ' ##' they asked him , ` ##` where is <span style="color:green">this man</span> ? ' ##' he answered , ` ##` i do n ##' ##t know . ' ##' then the people brought the man to the ph ##aris ##ees . the day jesus had made mud and healed the man ' ##s eyes was a sabbath day . so the ph ##aris ##ees asked the man , ` ##` how did you get your sight ? ' ##' he answered , ` ##` he put mud on my eyes . i washed , and now i can see . ' ##' some of the ph ##aris ##ees said , ` ##` <span style="color:green">that man</span> does not obey the law about the sabbath day . so <span style="color:green">he</span> is not from god . ' ##' others said , ` ##` but someone who is a sinn ##er can not do these miraculous signs . ' ##' so they could not agree with each other . they asked the man again , ` ##` since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ' ##' he answered , ` ##` he is a prophet . ' ##' the jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man - ##- that he was blind and was now healed . but later they sent for his parents . they asked them , ` ##` is this your son ? you say he was born blind . so how can he see ? ' ##' his parents answered , ` ##` we know that this man is our son . and we know that he was born blind . but we do n ##' ##t know why he can see now . we do n ##' ##t know who healed his eyes . ask him . he is old enough to answer for himself . ' ##' they said this because they were afraid of the jewish leaders . the leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said jesus was the christ . they would stop them from coming to the synagogue . that is why his parents said , ` ##` he is old enough . ask him . ' ##' so the jewish leaders called the man who had been blind . they told him to come in again . they said , ` ##` you should honor god by telling the truth . we know that this man is a sinn ##er . ' ##' the man answered , ` ##` i do n ##' ##t know if he is a sinn ##er . but i do know this : i was blind , and now i can see . ' ##' they asked , ` ##` what did he do to you ? how did he heal your eyes ? ' ##' he answered , ` ##` i have already told you that . but you would not listen to me . why do you want to hear it again ? do you want to be his followers too ? ' ##' at this they shouted insults at him and said , ` ##` you are his follower , not us ! we are followers of moses . we know that god spoke to moses . but we do n ##' ##t even know where this man comes from ! ' ##' the man answered , ` ##` this is really strange ! you do n ##' ##t know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes . we all know that god does not listen to sinn ##ers , but he will listen to anyone who worship ##s and obey ##s him . this is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind . this man must be from god . if he were not from god , he could not do anything like this . ' ##' the jewish leaders answered , ` ##` you were born full of sin ! are you trying to teach us ? ' ##' and they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out . when jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , ` ##` do you believe in the son of man ? ' ##' the man said , ` ##` tell me who he is , sir , so i can believe in him . ' ##' jesus said to him , ` ##` you have already seen him . the son of man is the one talking with you now . ' ##' the man answered , ` ##` yes , i believe , lord ! ' ##' then he bowed and worship ##ed jesus . jesus said , ` ##` i came into this world so that the world could be judged . i came so that people who are blind could see . and i came so that people who think they see would become blind . ' ##' some of the ph ##aris ##ees were near jesus . they heard him say this . they asked , ` ##` what ? are you saying that we are blind too ? ' ##' jesus said , ` ##` if you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin . but you say that you see , so you are still guilty . ' ##' [SEP]

[CLS] while apollo ##s was in the city of co ##rin ##th , paul was visiting some places on his way to ep ##hes ##us . in ep ##hes ##us he found some other followers of the lord . he asked them , ` ##` did you receive the holy spirit when you believed ? ' ##' these followers said to him , ` ##` we have never even heard of a holy spirit ! ' ##' paul asked them , ` ##` so what kind of baptism did you have ? ' ##' they said , ` ##` it was the baptism that john taught . ' ##' paul said , ` ##` john told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives . he told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is jesus . ' ##' when these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus . then paul laid his hands on them , and the holy spirit came on them . they began speaking different languages and prop ##hes ##ying . there were about twelve men in <span style="color:green">this group</span> . paul went into the synagogue and spoke very bold ##ly . he continued doing this for three months . he talked with the jews , trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about god ' ##s kingdom . but some of them became stubborn and refused to believe . in front of everyone , they said bad things about the way . so paul left <span style="color:green">these jews</span> and took <span style="color:green">the lord ' ##s</span> followers with him . he went to a place where a man named ty ##ran ##nus had a school . there paul talked with people every day . he did this for two years . because of this work , everyone in asia , jews and greeks , heard the word of the lord . god used paul to do some very special miracles . some people carried away handkerchief ##s and clothes that paul had used and put them on those who were sick . the sick people were healed , and evil spirits left them . some jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people . the seven sons of sc ##eva , one of the leading priests , were doing this . these jews tried to use the name of the lord jesus to make <span style="color:green">the evil spirits</span> go out of people . they all said , ` ##` by the same jesus that paul talks about , i order you to come out ! ' ##' but one time an evil spirit said to these jews , ` ##` i know jesus , and i know about paul , but who are you ? ' ##' then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these jews . he was much stronger than all of them . he beat them up and tore their clothes off . they all ran away from that house . all the people in ep ##hes ##us , jews and greeks , learned about this . they were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the lord jesus . many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done . some of them had used magic . these believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone . these books were worth about 50 , 000 silver coins . this is how the word of the lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe . after this , paul made plans to go to jerusalem . he planned to go through the regions of macedonia and ac ##hai ##a , and then go to jerusalem . he thought , ` ##` after i visit jerusalem , i must also visit rome .

[CLS] the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth . this place was inside a tent . the first area in the tent was called the holy place . in <span style="color:green">the holy place</span> were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to god . behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place . in the most holy place was a golden altar for burning incense . and also there was the box of the agreement . the box was covered with gold . inside this box was a golden jar of mann ##a and aaron ' ##s rod - ##- the rod that once grew leaves . also in the box were the flat stones with the ten command ##ments of the old agreement on them . above the box were the cher ##ub angels that showed god ' ##s glory . these cher ##ub angels were over the place of mercy . but we can not say everything about this now . everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties . but only the high priest could go into <span style="color:green">the second room</span> , and he went in only once a year . also , he could never enter <span style="color:green">that room</span> without taking blood with him . he offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinn ##ing . the holy spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there . this is an example for us today . it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the conscience ##s of the worship ##ers completely clear . these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washing ##s . they are only rules about the body . god gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way . but christ has already come to be the high priest . he is the high priest of the good things we now have . but christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in . he serves in a better place . unlike that tent , this one is perfect . [SEP]

[CLS] unlike <span style="color:blue">that tent</span> , this one is perfect . it was not made by anyone here on earth . it does not belong to this world . christ entered <span style="color:green">the most holy place</span> only one time - ##- enough for all time . he entered <span style="color:green">the most holy place</span> by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls . he entered there and made us free from sin forever . <span style="color:blue">the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow</span> were sp ##rin ##kled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship . <span style="color:blue">the blood and ashes</span> made them pure again - ##- but only their bodies . so surely the blood sacrifice of christ can do much more . christ offered himself through the eternal spirit as a perfect sacrifice to god . his blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done . it will give us clear conscience ##s so that we can worship the living god . so christ brings a new agreement from god to his people . he brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by god can have the blessings god promised , blessings that last forever . this can happen only because christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement . when <span style="color:green">someone</span> dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote <span style="color:blue">the will</span> is dead . a will means nothing while <span style="color:blue">the one who wrote <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">it</span></span></span> is still living . it can be used only after <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:green">that person ' ##s</span></span> death . that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and his people . first , moses told the people every command in the law . then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water . he used red wool and a branch of h ##ys ##sop to sp ##rin ##kle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people . then he said , ` ##` this is the blood that makes the agreement good - ##- the agreement that god commanded you to follow .

[CLS] the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth . this place was inside a tent . the first area in the tent was called the holy place . in <span style="color:green">the holy place</span> were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to god . behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place . in the most holy place was a golden altar for burning incense . and also there was the box of the agreement . the box was covered with gold . inside this box was a golden jar of mann ##a and aaron ' ##s rod - ##- the rod that once grew leaves . also in the box were the flat stones with the ten command ##ments of the old agreement on them . above the box were the cher ##ub angels that showed god ' ##s glory . these cher ##ub angels were over the place of mercy . but we can not say everything about this now . everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties . but only the high priest could go into <span style="color:green">the second room</span> , and he went in only once a year . also , he could never enter <span style="color:green">that room</span> without taking blood with him . he offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinn ##ing . the holy spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there . this is an example for us today . it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the conscience ##s of the worship ##ers completely clear . these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washing ##s . they are only rules about the body . god gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way . but christ has already come to be the high priest . he is the high priest of the good things we now have . but christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in . he serves in a better place . unlike that tent , this one is perfect . it was not made by anyone here on earth . it does not belong to this world . christ entered <span style="color:green">the most holy place</span> only one time - ##- enough for all time . he entered <span style="color:green">the most holy place</span> by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls . he entered there and made us free from sin forever . the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sp ##rin ##kled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship . the blood and ashes made them pure again - ##- but only their bodies . so surely the blood sacrifice of christ can do much more . christ offered himself through the eternal spirit as a perfect sacrifice to god . his blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done . it will give us clear conscience ##s so that we can worship the living god . so christ brings a new agreement from god to his people . he brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by god can have the blessings god promised , blessings that last forever . this can happen only because christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement . when someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead . a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . it can be used only after that person ' ##s death . that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and his people . first , moses told the people every command in the law . then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water . he used red wool and a branch of h ##ys ##sop to sp ##rin ##kle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people . then he said , ` ##` this is the blood that makes the agreement good - ##- the agreement that god commanded you to follow . ' ##' in the same way , moses sp ##rin ##kled the blood on the holy tent . he sp ##rin ##kled the blood over everything used in worship . the law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice . these things are copies of the real things that are in heaven . these copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . but the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices . christ went into the most holy place . but it was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of the real one . he went into heaven , and he is there now before god to help us . the high priest enters the most holy place once every year . he takes with him blood to offer . but he does not offer his own blood like christ did . christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again . if christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made . but he came to offer himself only once . and that once is enough for all time . he came at a time when the world is nearing an end . he came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice . everyone must die once . then they are judged . so christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . and he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin . he will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .

[CLS] and % ##uh , i turned in my master ' ##s thesis back in may , and i ' ##m actually presently working on , % ##um , several , % ##uh , articles oh , okay . impressive . from it . yeah , actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what i was doing , % ##uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . % ##uh , from what i had been reading in the literature . you see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in france for a year and a half . yeah . and this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n ##' ##t much discussion . yeah . yu ##p , yu ##p . but , % ##um anyway , i had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , i thought that this one little alteration i had made in my model was kind of clever and unique . m ##hm . and it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimental ##ly , but none of the other models % ##uh , had ? yes . the ##- , i ' ##m looking at , % ##um , multi mode lasers . and one of the things that they find experimental ##ly are what they call anti phased , % ##uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh ##- ##hu ##h . of the laser , you get an os ##ci ##llation which is characterized by one frequency . yes . okay . if you separate out the different modes of the laser m ##hm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency . okay . so what ' ##s happening is that <span style="color:green">the modes</span> are os ##ci ##lla ##ting out of phase so that <span style="color:green">they</span> completely mask each other ' ##s exactly . % ##hm . os ##ci ##llation ##s on these other frequencies . and % ##uh with a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient , but you ca n ##' ##t find that frequency in a driven , % ##uh , frequency . you ca n ##' ##t find so that it will sustain . okay . yes . so yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damp ##s out very quickly . and so you should n ##' ##t actually really be able to ever see it . % ##hm .

[CLS] and % ##uh , i turned in my master ' ##s thesis back in may , and i ' ##m actually presently working on , % ##um , several , % ##uh , articles oh , okay . impressive . from it . yeah , actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what i was doing , % ##uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . % ##uh , from what i had been reading in the literature . you see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in france for a year and a half . yeah . and this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n ##' ##t much discussion . yeah . yu ##p , yu ##p . but , % ##um anyway , i had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , i thought that this one little alteration i had made in my model was kind of clever and unique . m ##hm . and it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimental ##ly , but none of the other models % ##uh , had ? yes . the ##- , <span style="color:green">i</span> ' ##m looking at , % ##um , multi mode lasers . and one of the things that they find experimental ##ly are what they call anti phased , % ##uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh ##- ##hu ##h . of the laser , you get an os ##ci ##llation which is characterized by one frequency . yes . okay . if you separate out the different modes of the laser m ##hm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency . okay . so what ' ##s happening is that <span style="color:green">the modes</span> are os ##ci ##lla ##ting out of phase so that <span style="color:green">they</span> completely mask each other ' ##s exactly . % ##hm . os ##ci ##llation ##s on these other frequencies . and % ##uh with a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient , but you ca n ##' ##t find that frequency in a driven , % ##uh , frequency . you ca n ##' ##t find so that it will sustain . okay . yes . so yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damp ##s out very quickly . and so you should n ##' ##t actually really be able to ever see it . % ##hm . the only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it . got it , got it . i see . so , % ##um , i found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions ho ##rre ##ndo ##usly nasty . and in most cases , % ##uh , ins ##ol ##ub ##le . but yeah . it gives a driving term . oh , okay . so , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n ##' ##t always write it down very easily . exactly . oh wow . so you ' ##re pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , % ##uh , whatever it is science . but which , % ##um , is kind of interesting considering that that ' ##s not really my thing . . indeed . indeed . being an experimental ##ist , not a theorist . % ##um indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . but so are you going to get an article in nature or something ? % ##um , actually , i ' ##m not sure if we ' ##re shooting for op ##- , i think optics letters is probably the one that we ' ##re shooting for , or else , perhaps , though i do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s quite that significant , would be ph ##ys rev letters . % ##hm . but , % ##uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles . yeah . % ##hm . impressive . and i do n ##' ##t know how much you know about scientific literature , but letters are much more prestigious than , articles . oh , okay . oh , i did n ##' ##t realize that . okay . yeah , so that ' ##s why it ' ##s actually a big deal is i mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your master ' ##s thesis , is , not at all unusual in physics and yeah . % ##uh , it ' ##s the fact that i would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .

[CLS] and what ' ##s actually kind of interesting is i kept telling neil that i thought that this was kind of significant . and neil kept writing back that i should tone this part of the thesis down that you know , people see the anti phased motion , and it ' ##s true they do in the transient ##s and i was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transient ##s yes . % ##eh and not driven . and , % ##uh , what happened was after i had turned in my thesis but before i saw neil again , he went to a conference in rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n ##' ##t show this as a driven frequency , yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency . oh cool . and so neil then - ##- said oh just a second <span style="color:green">i</span> - ##- like a week later came to bryn ma ##wr and he said , hey lowell , we got to write this up . exactly . and i was like , well <span style="color:green">i</span> ' ##ve been telling you that neil . indeed . so cool . cool . that ' ##s mostly the sort of stuff that i ' ##m spending a lot of time on now . % ##um well it ' ##ll look good on your c v , your resume . so you might as well spend the time . yes , well , % ##uh , no , it ' ##s definitely worth doing . % ##um , and i would have been spending more time on <span style="color:green">it</span> if it were n ##' ##t for % ##uh dealing with the bu ##rg ##lary issues oh yeah but that i ' ##ve been dealing with . so are you still living in that house in the middle of the park . yes . yeah , okay . yeah . <span style="color:green">i</span> mean the thing that i ##- this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to . oh . it ' ##s not a question of whether or not , % ##uh you know , that was easy , it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into . exactly . exactly . yeah . and so the problem is that now they found out that it ' ##s worth breaking into . yeah .

' ##' the singer was brother je ##rma ##ine , and the claims based on the projected outline for <span style="color:green">his</span> abandoned ` ##` tell - all ' ##' family story . reading that joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards <span style="color:green">his</span> daughters is not exactly a ` ##` stop the presses ' ##' moment . what ' ##s new is this : je ##rma ##ine even suggested <span style="color:green">his father</span> may have set up michael to be somehow victim ##ized by older men . he tells how <span style="color:green">his father</span> would have michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with ` ##` important business people , ' ##' and wondered whether ` ##` something happened ' ##' to michael at those sessions . he said he sensed something was wrong because michael would be sick for days after . ` ##` what was joseph doing ? ' ##' je ##rma ##ine wrote . this lifts the jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege . this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward . all that ' ##s missing is the element of occult terror . or maybe not : ` ##` la ##toy ##a also described being awakened in the night by joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ' ##' perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the jackson clan had gotten with the program . perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre ##- ##ex ##ist ##ing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . - ##lr ##b ##- this is how i tend to think of po ##nch ##ato ##ula ' ##s ho ##san ##na church . - ##rr ##b ##- yet we should n ##' ##t discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of michael ' ##s paranormal interests and peculiar associations . his close friendship with spectra contact ##ee and channel ##ler of the nine , ur ##i gel ##ler , for one instance . - ##lr ##b ##- jackson was gel ##ler ' ##s best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year gel ##ler is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . - ##rr ##b ##- his entourage including a ` ##` personal magician ' ##' for another . even if you wanted to , you wo n ##' ##t be reading je ##rma ##ine ' ##s account now . like every jackson sibling who ' ##s tried to break from joe , he ' ##s climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of michael ' ##s threats to sue . previously , michael ' ##s given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body d ##ys ##mo ##rp ##hia to a dread of resembling his father . yet there they were at jackson ' ##s trial last year , hand in hand . in the big picture michael jackson means not very much . but his little picture may be more news ##worthy than the news suggests . good stuff . having departed last june for a bahrain ` ##` vacation ' ##' from which he ' ##s yet to emerge . actually , there have been reports for the past two days of jackson back in california . # ##name ? wild wild stuff jeff ! di ##sin ##form ##ation distraction di ##s and dat . ##. the net ##werk is as sacred to the state as their mantra ` ##` my way or total ann ##ih ##ilation .
