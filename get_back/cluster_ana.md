[CLS] hello , dear viewers . welcome to focus today . today , let ' ##s turn <span style="color:red">our</span> attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in <span style="color:yellow">beijing</span> over the holiday . before dawn on <span style="color:yellow">january 3</span> , a sewage pipe leak ##age accident occurred at the main and side roads of jing ##gua ##ng bridge , east third ring road , beijing municipality , resulting in <span style="color:yellow">the road ca ##ving in</span> . relevant departments from beijing municipality promptly activated emergency con ##ting ##ency plans . the traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene . well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ? after the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak com ##mute ? in addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ? well , <span style="color:red">we</span> have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with <span style="color:red">us</span> . one of <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">the two honorable guests</span> in the studio</span> is professor zhou han ##hua from the institute of law of the chinese academy of social sciences . hello . next is yang yang , a host of beijing traffic radio station . hello . welcome both of you to the studio to participate in <span style="color:red">our</span> program . well , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> especially want to know , <span style="color:red">ha</span> , how the two of you found out <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">the news</span> on the day of the accident</span> ? ah , , about 11 ##: ##00 m ##. <span style="color:yellow">yesterday</span> , ah , i happened to find out through <span style="color:red">an sms</span> when i was outside . uh ##- ##hu ##h . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it happened that i was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at <span style="color:yellow">noon</span> . and then , the friend first sent me an sms , uh ##- ##hu ##h . saying he would come pick me up to go together . after that , i received <span style="color:red">an sms</span> from 1860 . uh ##- ##hu ##h , <span style="color:red">it</span> was through an sms . and you , yang yang ? a friend happened to call me . you were not at work that day ? no . the station called me at <span style="color:yellow">noon</span> and said something happened at jing ##gua ##ng bridge and that i had to go to the station immediately to research <span style="color:red">the upcoming program</span> . uh ##- ##hu ##h , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station . right , right , right . uh ##- ##hu ##h . well , like professor zhou , i also received this news , <span style="color:red">ha</span> , through a mobile phone sms . at that time , , it can be said that this sms was among the many , <span style="color:red">ha</span> , sms containing <span style="color:red">new year</span> wishes , like <span style="color:red">happy new year</span> , received after the start of the new year . uh ##- ##hu ##h . ah , actually <span style="color:yellow">i</span> felt a lot of warmth when <span style="color:yellow">i</span> received <span style="color:yellow">that sms</span> . although we live in the west instead of the east and <span style="color:yellow">it</span> did not affect us much , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news . yes , exceptionally . yes , exceptionally . [SEP]

[CLS] well , what in fact was the content of that sms ? let ' ##s take a look via this footage , <span style="color:red">ha</span> . i remember the sms was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leak ##age accident on the side road at the southeast corner of jing ##gua ##ng bridge at east third ring road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near chao ##yang road , jing ##gua ##ng bridge , and east third ring road , and requesting cars to make a det ##our . some car owners said that it was very good that the sms was sent . furthermore , there was one last sentence in that sms thanking citizens for their cooperation and support . ah , after the sms was sent , , i felt it seems to be the first time that beijing municipality , ah , used an sms to give notification at the time of a public emergency . i do n ##' ##t know , all of us are living in beijing , is <span style="color:red">this</span> the first time , <span style="color:red">professor zhou</span> ? yes , in terms of an official notification , <span style="color:red">this</span> should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 . uh ##- ##hu ##h . of course , in private life , people have used sms countless times to spread news . yes . other places in the country must have used this too . uh ##- ##hu ##h , uh ##- ##hu ##h . must have used this too . actually , <span style="color:red">i</span> remember <span style="color:red">receiving</span> <span style="color:yellow">an sms like <span style="color:yellow">this one</span></span> last year before it snow ##ed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in beijing to a rather large extent . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time . uh ##- ##hu ##h . ah , when an sms is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ? yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by beijing municipality , uh ##- ##hu ##h . an extremely good point that is worth ponder ##ing deeply , worthy innovation . uh ##- ##hu ##h . for instance , previously <span style="color:red">our news announcements</span> were made through some conventional methods , but this time <span style="color:red">it</span> was made in the form of a mobile phone sms . in fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment . [SEP]

[CLS] we usually make it sound like e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment is something una ##tta ##ina ##ble . yes , when we talked about e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment in the past , it seemed to be only done through the internet . right . it seemed that computers , ah , and the internet , ah , were an expression of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment , to let people find out information . well , presently in fact , e ##- ##go ##vern ##ments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic id ##s , and such as , these electronic signatures . these are quite sophisticated forms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . in particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone sms , are applied in e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment . hence , i think this is , a test of e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment because , as i remember , during sar ##s in <span style="color:yellow">2003</span> , <span style="color:red">people at <span style="color:yellow">that time</span></span> criticized e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment during the spread of sar ##s , ah . uh ##- ##hu ##h . <span style="color:red">they</span> said that e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment was very good but was not put into use . well , this time i think that a short sms like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through <span style="color:red">this e ##- ##go ##vern ##ment form</span> . uh ##- ##hu ##h . yes . we drive often in beijing , ha , <span style="color:yellow">yang yang</span> . if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ? yes . ah , well , i think it would have been <span style="color:red">real paralysis</span> . <span style="color:red">this</span> is the most appropriate word to use . furthermore , i think that when <span style="color:red">sms</span> was used to announce the news , <span style="color:red">it</span> should be said to have fit the conditions in our china very well . why is that so ? this is because , it should be said that china is the country with the highest sms usage . there are probably not as many chances to use sms in foreign countries compared with domestically , in china , ah . so , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using <span style="color:yellow">the most familiar method</span> , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement . yes , i noticed that many friends , around me received it .

[CLS] so , how exactly did citizens react ? let ' ##s take a look at the reactions of citizens . - ##- <span style="color:red">an sms .</span> i saw <span style="color:red">it</span> was that jing ##gua ##ng bridge . hey , i say , <span style="color:red">this</span> is quite good , quite good . have you received information like <span style="color:red">this</span> before ? no , no . this was <span style="color:red">the first time</span> . <span style="color:red">the first time</span> ? yes , yes . well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded <span style="color:red">this time</span> ? quite fast . really quite fast , ah . so , i did not drive today . i set out a bit earlier and took the subway here . do you think that the response of the government was fast <span style="color:red">this time</span> ? ah , the response was quite fast . in addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt . colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and sms . i think this plan was quite speedy . it seems that through this kind of sms , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha . well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression . let ' ##s find out the situation at that time through <span style="color:red">some footage</span> . well , we know that after <span style="color:yellow">the road cave - in accident</span> , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes . well , lots of barr ##ica ##de tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of <span style="color:yellow">the accident scene</span> beneath the jing ##gua ##ng bridge at east third ring road . all personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations . see , through <span style="color:red">this footage</span> , we see , ah , this - ##- uh ##- ##hu ##h . okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o ##' ##cl ##ock . that means that <span style="color:yellow">they</span> arrived at the scene right after the pre ##- ##da ##wn accident occurred . well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news . [SEP]

[CLS] well , ah , yang yang , you work at <span style="color:yellow">traffic radio station</span> , ha , well , and we know that you all gave <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">an extensive live broadcast</span> this morning</span> . <span style="color:red">a special program</span> . yes , a special program on this traffic . so , let ' ##s first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident . judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are <span style="color:yellow">the effects</span> ? actually , concerning this , i think <span style="color:red">both of you</span> are very familiar with the traffic in beijing . previously <span style="color:yellow">we</span> had a stat ##istic , especially for the ring roads in beijing . that is , if <span style="color:yellow">we</span> have <span style="color:yellow">an ordinary fender bender or tail ##gate accident on a bridge such as the jing ##gua ##ng bridge of the third ring road</span> , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jam ##s during these morning and evening peak periods . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road . well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods . well , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jing ##gua ##ng bridge to chang ##hong bridge from the south all the way to guo ##ma ##o bridge , blocking the main and side roads . well , the situation would be un ##thi ##nka ##ble during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone . hence , at that time , before 6 ##: ##30 a . ##m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried . however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending <span style="color:red">the live broadcast</span> <span style="color:yellow">this evening</span> to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on <span style="color:red">the roads surrounding <span style="color:red">the section under traffic control</span></span> , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , the affected area was not as large as expected . moreover , some people made det ##ours once they received the news .

[CLS] well , ah , yang yang , you work at <span style="color:yellow">traffic radio station</span> , ha , well , and we know that you all gave <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">an extensive live broadcast</span> this morning</span> . <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">a special program</span> .</span> yes , a special program on this traffic . so , let ' ##s first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident . judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are <span style="color:yellow">the effects</span> ? actually , concerning this , i think <span style="color:red">both of you</span> are very familiar with the traffic in beijing . previously we had a stat ##istic , especially for the ring roads in beijing . that is , if <span style="color:yellow">we</span> have <span style="color:yellow">an ordinary fender bender or tail ##gate accident on a bridge such as the jing ##gua ##ng bridge of the third ring road</span> , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jam ##s during these morning and evening peak periods . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road . well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods . well , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jing ##gua ##ng bridge to chang ##hong bridge from the south all the way to guo ##ma ##o bridge , blocking the main and side roads . well , the situation would be un ##thi ##nka ##ble during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone . hence , at that time , before 6 ##: ##30 a . ##m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried . however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending <span style="color:red">the live broadcast</span> <span style="color:yellow">this evening</span> to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on <span style="color:red">the roads surrounding <span style="color:red">the section under traffic control</span></span> , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam . uh ##- ##hu ##h . however , the affected area was not as large as expected . moreover , some people made det ##ours once they received the news . right . psychological ##ly , people felt quite relieved . because <span style="color:red">i</span> know <span style="color:yellow">this situation</span> . right , like those whom <span style="color:red">we</span> interviewed just now . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> was easy to handle once everyone understood . yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , i set out <span style="color:red">today</span> before the incident , and i did not drive after i was informed . <span style="color:yellow">that person</span> did not even drive . right . actually , in this aspect , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think that citizens were really quite cooperative . for instance , <span style="color:yellow">this evening</span> , we , received an sms . <span style="color:yellow">a friend</span> said , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> work on the 12th floor of <span style="color:yellow">the china world trade center at the guo ##ma ##o bridge</span> , ah . <span style="color:yellow">we</span> were discussing that <span style="color:yellow">we</span> could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route . later on , we suggested to <span style="color:yellow">him</span> and said , <span style="color:yellow">you</span> , ah , might as well <span style="color:yellow">take</span> <span style="color:yellow">the subway</span> , because you can directly reach <span style="color:yellow">the subway</span> once you get down from <span style="color:yellow">the china world trade center</span> . right . hey , <span style="color:yellow">he</span> said <span style="color:yellow">this</span> was quite a good idea . actually , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect . [SEP]

[CLS] yes , many , viewers not in beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with <span style="color:red">this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident</span> occurred . ah , we can take a look later through an animation . <span style="color:red">this road</span> represents a main road on east third ring road , with problems on both <span style="color:red">the main and side roads</span> . furthermore , chao ##yang road is an intersection . uh ##- ##hu ##h . whether it is <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">chao ##yang road</span> in the east - west direction</span> or <span style="color:yellow">the main and side roads of east third ring road in the south - north direction</span> , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of east third ring road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during com ##mut ##ing times . well , chao ##yang road is a very important artery in the east - west direction . yes . when people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road . hence , if a traffic accident occurs at <span style="color:red">this place</span> , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jam ##s . yes , actually i think everyone can see that from the buses that cross jing ##gua ##ng bridge . yes . as buses that cross <span style="color:red">the third ring road</span> are currently , right now affected by the jing ##gua ##ng bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout <span style="color:yellow">the neighborhood</span> have had to be re ##routed . uh ##- ##hu ##h . well , i think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes . if the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many - ##- it is really like this , just look at the bus signs . right . have not seen so many buses . right . its effect on people has been extremely extensive . yes . [SEP]

[CLS] uh ##- ##hu ##h . well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ? our correspondent specially interviewed <span style="color:yellow">director meng xi ##an ##long , mr ##. meng xi ##an ##long , of <span style="color:yellow">the command center of the beijing municipal traffic administration</span></span> . let ' ##s hear what <span style="color:yellow">director meng</span> said . um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan . in the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends . in this way , all vehicles going along east third ring road had to make a det ##our to go on roads on the east and west sides . east third ring road is a traffic artery in the east of beijing that links the north and the south . in order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans . we set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along east second ring road , east fourth ring road , west da ##wang road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic . it can be said that measures were very promptly taken . ah , today is the first work ##day after the new year holiday . well , what exactly was the situation this morning ? we specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage . let ' ##s take a look at the situation this morning through this footage . well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at east third ring road , ah , near gu ##ang ##hua bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of jing ##gua ##ng bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations . although the outdoor temperature in beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making det ##ours . well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly . [SEP]

[CLS] ah , it can be said , ah , <span style="color:yellow">yang yang</span> , citizens , regardless of whether they took <span style="color:red">the bus</span> or drove , their mental ##ity , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene . uh ##- ##hu ##h . right , right . , through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ? actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell <span style="color:yellow">us</span> about it via mobile phone sms . since we know that jing ##gua ##ng bridge is located in the cb ##d district , well there are <span style="color:red">many office buildings , ah , a lot of them</span> , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work . therefore , they sent sms saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for <span style="color:red">me</span> to be walking to the bus station today or going to take <span style="color:red">the bus</span> . well , it is unusual for <span style="color:red">me</span> to enjoy a very pleasant morning . <span style="color:yellow">we</span> then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing . this shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with <span style="color:yellow">a very calm and pleasant state of mind</span> . i think that this mental ##ity in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mental ##ity that <span style="color:red">beijing</span> citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calm ##ness and maturity after having experienced frustration ##s . on the other hand , i think it can also fully show the level of people ' ##s satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident . that is , they think that the government has tried its best . well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts . uh ##- ##hu ##h . as such , in this regard , i think people ' ##s mental ##ity can become very calm . [SEP]

[CLS] uh ##- ##hu ##h . well , professor zhou , from this perspective , is <span style="color:red">this</span> one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ? yes . in terms of citizens ' mental ##ity . yes , in fact <span style="color:red">it</span> can be seen from this particular case . that is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally un ##ila ##tera ##l administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well . we know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed . time was lost . well , yes , the state council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms . that is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do . in this way , related interaction between <span style="color:yellow">the government and the people</span> can be formed . that is , in modern public management , ah , <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of un ##ila ##tera ##l administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between <span style="color:yellow">the government and the people</span> . i think in fact , we can sum up <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">many beneficial experiences</span> from this case</span> and actually extend them to other areas . yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .

[CLS] traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred . however , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects . yes . yang yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ? right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground . they include those like <span style="color:red">you</span> just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others . truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens . closely linked . yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives . let ' ##s take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene . ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the beijing municipal construction commission , ah , the communication commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work . relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people ' ##s daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period . well , looking at the government ' ##s response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life . [SEP]

[CLS] well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved <span style="color:yellow">many departments</span> after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ? yes . this is also - ##- it is not the case that <span style="color:red">this problem</span> will be totally solved when one department shows up . yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries . how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups . yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society . it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified . uh ##- ##hu ##h . how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ? well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for <span style="color:red">departments</span> to cooperate with one another . for instance , there are <span style="color:yellow">too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments</span> , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate . however , this time , through the execution of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role . hence , i think this was also a kind of , er , trial of inter ##de ##par ##tment ##al cooperation mechanisms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it was a very successful , er , response . i think many good things can be sum ##med up from <span style="color:yellow">this</span> . yes . yang yang , based on <span style="color:red">your understanding</span> , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people ' ##s lives were damaged after the accident , based on <span style="color:red">your understanding of the situation</span> , how was re ##media ##l work carried out ? for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently . er , heating pipes were indeed damaged . well , at the time , <span style="color:red">it</span> affected residents living in an area of about 70 ##, ##00 ##0 square meters of beijing . [SEP]

[CLS] well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved <span style="color:yellow">many departments</span> after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ? yes . this is also - ##- it is not the case that <span style="color:red">this problem</span> will be totally solved when one department shows up . yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries . how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups . yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society . it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified . uh ##- ##hu ##h . how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ? well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for <span style="color:red">departments</span> to cooperate with one another . for instance , there are <span style="color:yellow">too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments</span> , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate . however , this time , through the execution of emergency con ##ting ##ency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role . hence , i think this was also a kind of , er , trial of inter ##de ##par ##tment ##al cooperation mechanisms . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it was a very successful , er , response . i think many good things can be sum ##med up from <span style="color:yellow">this</span> . yes . yang yang , based on <span style="color:red">your understanding</span> , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people ' ##s lives were damaged after the accident , based on <span style="color:red">your understanding of the situation</span> , how was re ##media ##l work carried out ? for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently . er , heating pipes were indeed damaged . well , at the time , it affected residents living in <span style="color:red">an area of about 70 ##, ##00 ##0 square meters of beijing</span> . well , , in this regard , the chao ##yang district government did a very good job . after it , er , received this order from <span style="color:yellow">the municipal government</span> , it immediately sent , electric heat ##ers to residents in more than 200 households within <span style="color:red">this area</span> . it should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday . well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly . hence , over here , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think <span style="color:yellow">the municipal government , ah , including sub ##- ##dis ##tric ##t offices</span> , <span style="color:yellow">made</span> a lot of effort to take good care of resident households . <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think <span style="color:yellow">it</span> was done in a very humanitarian manner . uh ##- ##hu ##h . uh ##- ##hu ##h . [SEP]

[CLS] professor zhou , actually for such a large scale city as beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like <span style="color:yellow">this</span> should be said to be relatively common . yes . i think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations . for instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents . perhaps many overseas cities have <span style="color:yellow">had</span> such kind of thing before . <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is because a city is a gathering place for modern life . it is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict . hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur . <span style="color:red">the critical thing</span> is - ##- but the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is a test of its response capabilities . yes . yes . yes , i think through a few incidents that happened in beijing municipality over recent years , such as sar ##s , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and <span style="color:yellow">the road cave - in at east third ring road this time</span> , i think it can be seen that beijing municipality ' ##s response capabilities continued to improve each time . right . it can be said that <span style="color:yellow">this time</span> , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone . [SEP]

[CLS] um , well , i think , yang yang , perhaps you <span style="color:yellow">have</span> stronger feelings on this aspect , ah . yes . because <span style="color:yellow">you</span> often have this kind of direct sms exchange with listeners . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> is because , we , beijing traffic radio station , has become a part of emergency planning in beijing . well , beijing traffic radio station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above . well , for instance , as people still vivid ##ly remember , at <span style="color:yellow">the time of <span style="color:red">that snowfall just mentioned by professor zhou that people still vivid ##ly remember</span></span> , there were no plans . beijing municipality still had no emergency plan . well , at that time , it happened that i was hosting the un ##block ##ed all the way program in the studio that evening . well , at that time , <span style="color:red">traffic</span> was not at all un ##block ##ed . ah , at <span style="color:yellow">that time</span> there was none of this kind of interaction . it was not clear , <span style="color:red">it</span> was very cong ##ested . you sat inside the studio and only knew about <span style="color:red">the heavy snowfall</span> . you could find out other news only by telephone . the various methods and channels were extremely unclear . well , later , when <span style="color:yellow">we</span> experienced <span style="color:yellow">that rainfall</span> in beijing , <span style="color:yellow">that rainfall two years ago</span> , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner . from <span style="color:yellow">our</span> perspective as media , i think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that <span style="color:yellow">we</span> could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notification ##s , and instructions . yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a pro ##active participant when there is a public emergency in the city . yes . it should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies . [SEP]

[CLS] ah , apart from this , professor zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ? right , i think this gave us many revelations , ah . first , i think one that should be especially important <span style="color:yellow">is</span> early warnings and forecast ##s . <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah . early warnings and forecast ##s . yes , <span style="color:yellow">this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism</span> . uh ##- ##hu ##h . it is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents . uh ##- ##hu ##h . that is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up . uh ##- ##hu ##h . in this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency . uh ##- ##hu ##h . another thing i want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , i think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post ##- ##in ##cide ##nt , responsibility system . in fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect . for instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility . we have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others . that is to say , we have many corresponding systems . however , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases . since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urban ##ized life , well , i think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability . [SEP]

[CLS] um , well , based on <span style="color:yellow">your</span> understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worth ##while for us to learn ? i think , in comparison to <span style="color:yellow">china</span> , we should say that urban ##ization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread . their level of development is more advanced than <span style="color:yellow">ours</span> . although the scale of our urban ##ization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , i think , with <span style="color:yellow">our</span> economic development being relatively backward , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries . for instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries . with a background of liberal ##ization , market ##ization , and privatization , how can <span style="color:yellow">the government</span> strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ? how can a safe , assured system be established ? well , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> need to learn and manage this . uh ##- ##hu ##h . for instance , regarding information disclosure , well , <span style="color:yellow">our</span> speed of information disclosure this time was very fast . however , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility . well , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances . well , for <span style="color:red">some of <span style="color:yellow">our</span> emergency con ##ting ##ency plans</span> , well , ah , how will <span style="color:red">these emergency con ##ting ##ency plans</span> withstand these tests ? we know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people ' ##s governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency con ##ting ##ency plans for public emergencies , but <span style="color:yellow">many of them</span> have not been put to the test . well , how will they undergo testing ? these also include some of our command and policy - making systems . so , with the growth of urban ##ization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , i think there will be increasingly high requirements on <span style="color:red">the systems</span> . that is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities . how can <span style="color:yellow">we</span> institutional ##ize <span style="color:yellow">our</span> response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?

style="color:yellow">she</span> able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail . well exactly . and <span style="color:yellow">you</span> know what <span style="color:yellow">howie</span> . . it ' ##s really time for <span style="color:yellow">lucy</span> and other <span style="color:yellow">judy miller</span> defenders to update <span style="color:yellow">her</span> talking points because what <span style="color:yellow">lucy</span> just said just simply does not wash . the truth is that as <span style="color:yellow">howie</span> said <span style="color:yellow">she</span> did testify . the truth is that it ' ##s very clear from the stories <span style="color:yellow">today</span> that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> could ' ##ve asked uh <span style="color:yellow">sc ##oot ##er libby</span> to call <span style="color:yellow">her</span> so that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> could hear the timber of <span style="color:yellow">his</span> voice earlier . <span style="color:yellow">all of that</span> could have happened . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> did not happen because clearly <span style="color:yellow">judy miller</span> is protecting another source that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> still has not revealed to <span style="color:yellow">the american public</span> . and <span style="color:yellow">the new york times</span> is . <span style="color:yellow">lucy .</span> . let <span style="color:yellow">me</span> get a response from <span style="color:yellow">lucy dal ##gli ##sh</span> . <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think it ' ##s very obvious from what <span style="color:yellow">judy</span> wrote <span style="color:yellow">today</span> <span style="color:yellow">she</span> is protecting somebody else . and one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was <span style="color:yellow">she</span> negotiating what <span style="color:yellow">she</span> was going to say about <span style="color:yellow">sc ##oot ##er libby</span> but you got to keep in mind <span style="color:yellow">i</span> ' ##m a lawyer there were <span style="color:yellow">lawyers involved in this</span> . <span style="color:yellow">they</span> had to negotiate with <span style="color:yellow">patrick fitzgerald</span> what <span style="color:yellow">he</span> would not talk about . <span style="color:yellow">they</span> also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contact ##ing . once you in ##vo ##ke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful . you do n ##' ##t mess with the fed ##s . it ' ##s very clear in <span style="color:yellow">her</span> story that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> decided finally to testify because <span style="color:yellow">she</span> got tired of jail because <span style="color:yellow">she</span> was threatened with criminal contempt charges because <span style="color:yellow">she</span> wanted to go out and now <span style="color:yellow">she</span> ' ##s saying admitting finally write a book . all these things are there in black and white . and to continue to portray <span style="color:yellow">her</span> as a martyr is not going to work . and on <span style="color:yellow">that point</span> <span style="color:yellow">aria ##nna</span> on <span style="color:yellow">that point</span> <span style="color:yellow">she</span> says sh ##- / ##- excuse <span style="color:yellow">me</span> . <span style="color:yellow">judy miller</span> says <span style="color:yellow">she</span> ' ##s taking some time off from <span style="color:yellow">the paper</span> . <span style="color:yellow">she</span> wants to write <span style="color:yellow">a book</span> . <span style="color:yellow">she</span> would n ##' ##t share <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">her</span> notes</span> with <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">her</span> colleagues who were writing the story</span> . do <span style="color:yellow">you</span> think <span style="color:yellow">she</span> ' ##ll ever come back ? <span style="color:yellow">you</span> think <span style="color:yellow">she</span> ' ##s saving it for <span style="color:yellow">the book</span> ? well it ' ##s very clear that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> would not be welcome in the news ##room . and it ' ##s very clear eh as <span style="color:yellow">i</span> reported again that when <span style="color:yellow">bill keller</span> took <span style="color:yellow">her</span> off <span style="color:yellow">her</span> w ##md beat they were all hoping <span style="color:yellow">she</span> would resign . instead <span style="color:yellow">she</span> threw a fit . but <span style="color:yellow">she</span> stayed on . this is not a journalism one oh one course the way <span style="color:yellow">she</span> handled both the w ##md reporting and pl ##ame gate . <span style="color:yellow">frank se ##s ##no</span> please comment . jump in . and <span style="color:yellow">howie</span> <span style="color:yellow">i</span> ' ##ll tell <span style="color:yellow">you</span> what . this is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with <span style="color:yellow">your correspond ##ants and your reporters</span> . you got to know who <span style="color:yellow">they</span> ' ##re talking to at some level anyway because you know what ? it ' ##s about trust with <span style="color:yellow">the public</span> . and it ' ##s about you know ending up in jail or in court . <span style="color:yellow">their</span> story says that <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">bill keller</span> and arthur sul ##z ##berger</span> did not press <span style="color:yellow">judy miller</span> about <span style="color:yellow">her</span> conversations with

[SEP]

##s</span> on <span style="color:yellow">september nineteenth of two thousand five</span> <span style="color:yellow">those types of assurance ##s</span> are in that agreement . but the north koreans

##ble way before all those assurance ##s can go into place . all the other elements of the agreement can be put into place . and what we ' ##ve seen since then is we ' ##ve seen <span

entire agreement that you just referred to tim . but <span style="color:yellow">we</span> see the north koreans walking away from it . so we ' ##ve got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with <span style="color:yellow">these other countries</span> to pressure the north koreans to live up to their commitments . but we would be willing to give north korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated ? the north koreans know what ' ##s in the <span style="color:yellow">september nineteenth</span> agreement . and it ' ##s very specific about what the united states is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they di ##sman ##tle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction . but they ' ##ve got responsibilities in this agreement . and no agreement is whole until both sides meet <span style="color:red">their agreement</span> . and what we ' ##ve seen tim especially on july fourth is the north koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last september . why do you think the north koreans chose july fourth ? oh i do n ##' ##t think it was coincide ##ntal . you know <span style="color:yellow">it</span> ' ##s a very unreliable and unpredictable regime . the last thing we want to do is react to <span

il</span> is a tyrant a p ##y ##gm ##y and a spoiled child . <span style="color:yellow">kim jong - il</span> is a des ##pot . and <span style="color:yellow">he</span> is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over <span style="color:yellow">the world</span> . uh <span style="color:yellow">these missile tests the other day</span> were certainly reckless . <span style="color:yellow">they</span> were provocative . and so uh <span style="color:yellow">we</span> have n ##' ##t changed <span style="color:yellow">our</span> opinion of the nature of <span style="color:yellow">the regime in <span style="color:yellow">north korea</span></span> . no one in <span style="color:yellow">our</span> government has . <span style="color:yellow">we</span> are very clear - eyed about who <span style="color:yellow">they</span> are , what <span style="color:yellow">they</span> represent , how much <span style="color:yellow">they</span> ' ##ve denied <span style="color:yellow">their</span> own people the basic human rights that people should have around <span style="color:yellow">the world</span> . and <span style="color:yellow">we</span> ' ##re focused on this nuclear question as well . so <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think there ' ##s been a lot of continuity over <span style="color:yellow">american policy</span> both in the substance of <span style="color:yellow">the policy</span> and in the way <span style="color:yellow">we</span> ' ##ve talked about <span style="color:yellow">north korea</span> over the last several years . and uh <span style="color:yellow">we</span> ' ##re determined to press ahead .

uh , once a week ! what do <span style="color:red">you</span> talk about ? i will talk about my studies and life . my school ##work was not quite good when i first came ! my mother sc ##old ##ed me in the beginning when my school ##work was poor . she said that i was losing honor for not doing well at school ! then i <span style="color:yellow">cried</span> and after <span style="color:yellow">that</span> , my mother cried , too . since <span style="color:yellow">they</span> move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of <span style="color:yellow">left - behind children</span> have little communication with <span style="color:yellow">their children</span> . while for temporary cu ##sto ##dian ##s , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure <span style="color:yellow">the children</span> have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating <span style="color:yellow">the children</span> . <span style="color:yellow">the survey</span> found that <span style="color:yellow">36 ##. ##7 percent of <span style="color:yellow">the children</span></span> had never been to <span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents ' workplace . <span style="color:yellow">8 ##. ##2 percent of <span style="color:yellow">the parents</span></span> almost never contacted <span style="color:yellow">their</span> children . <span style="color:yellow">21 ##. ##4 percent of <span style="color:yellow">the parents</span></span> contacted <span style="color:yellow">their</span> children less than once a month . since <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents</span> are absent , how can <span style="color:yellow">these children</span> communicate and exchange with <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents</span> ? <span style="color:yellow">our study</span> found that um , um , the principal means of contact between <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">the left - behind children</span> and <span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents</span> was through the telephone . however , contrary to our belief that <span style="color:yellow">they</span> could talk on the phone for a long time when <span style="color:yellow">they</span> called , <span style="color:yellow">approximately 50 percent of <span style="color:yellow">the left - behind children we surveyed</span></span> talked on the phone with <span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents for three minutes or so . what could they talk about in three minutes ? <span style="color:yellow">i</span> think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes . of course , we also studied what <span style="color:yellow">these children</span> talked to <span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations . what did <span style="color:yellow">the parents who worked in the city</span> talk about with <span style="color:yellow">their</span> children ? what touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of <span style="color:yellow">the children ' ##s</span> conversations with <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents</span> was to ask about <span style="color:yellow">their</span> safety and not other things , such as how much <span style="color:yellow">they</span> had earned . as for <span style="color:yellow">the content of <span style="color:yellow">the parents '</span> conversations with <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">their</span> children</span></span> , first , <span style="color:yellow">it</span> was school . whether <span style="color:yellow">they</span> were good and how <span style="color:yellow">their</span> school ##work was . second , <span style="color:yellow">it</span> was whether <span style="color:yellow">they</span> obeyed <span style="color:yellow">their</span> cu ##sto ##dian ##s and what <span style="color:yellow">they</span> ate and things like that . uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange . we know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause <span style="color:yellow">is</span> a need for emotional exchange . however , <span style="color:yellow">the parents</span> may not have realized <span style="color:yellow">this</span> . for instance , <span style="color:yellow">the child</span> has stopped talking . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> stops talking because <span style="color:yellow">he</span> needs to pause to consider how to say what is in <span style="color:yellow">his</span> mind . <span style="color:yellow">the parents</span> may not have realized this point , so <span style="color:yellow">they</span> hang up the phone immediately . of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ? in many cases , it was because <span style="color:yellow">they</span> worried about the charge . , <span style="color:yellow">many left - behind children</span> told us that <span style="color:yellow">they</span> especially wanted to call <span style="color:yellow">their</span> parents on the phone . however , um , <span style="color:yellow">they</span> considered that um , one thing , sometimes <span style="color:yellow">they</span> did not have a telephone at home . it was very difficult for <span style="color:yellow">children</span> to borrow the phone from <span style="color:yellow">their</span> neighbors . second , um , <span style="color:yellow">they</span> considered that <span style="color:yellow">they</span> needed money to make a phone call . some children told <span style="color:yellow">me</span> , " <span style="color:yellow">i</span> secretly called <span style="color:yellow">my</span> parents when <span style="color:yellow">my</span> cu ##sto ##dian ##s were not home . " <span style="color:yellow">the children</span> have a great need for this type of telephone exchange . [SEP]

[CLS] do the left - behind children understand why <span style="color:red">their parents</span> work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> ? um , um , we conducted a survey on this question . we were very surprised to find that 40 percent of <span style="color:red">the left - behind children</span> <span style="color:yellow">had</span> no idea what jobs <span style="color:red">their parents</span> held away from home . how could that be possible ? how could that be possible ? we interviewed <span style="color:yellow">some left - behind children</span> , their cu ##sto ##dian ##s , and <span style="color:yellow">the people who work in <span style="color:red">the city</span></span> . why would n ##' ##t the children know what they did ? first , <span style="color:yellow">we</span> can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of <span style="color:red">the parents who work in <span style="color:red">the city</span></span> . however , a lot of <span style="color:yellow">the work that <span style="color:red">the parents</span> engaged in</span> is <span style="color:red">dangerous work , including coal ##mine ##s , construction , and some others</span> , many of them are dangerous jobs . thus , i believe the parents of these left - behind children also <span style="color:yellow">choose</span> not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of <span style="color:red">their job</span> . why do they do <span style="color:yellow">that</span> ? it is because they are afraid that their children will worry . second , , <span style="color:yellow">parents , especially fathers , who work in <span style="color:red">the city</span></span> have <span style="color:yellow">a particularly loft ##y image in the children ' ##s mind</span> . maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of <span style="color:red">their job</span> or tell them what they do . they , do not want to destroy <span style="color:yellow">the loft ##y image of themselves in <span style="color:red">the child ' ##s</span> mind</span> . at noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in <span style="color:red">the field</span> and did not come home . jiang bei ##wen <span style="color:red">has</span> to <span style="color:yellow">make</span> lunch for himself . this happens to him very often . he could look after himself since he was nine . what work are you going to do today , other than cooking ? uh , i will do the dishes after i finish eating . if it is sunday when i am free , i will , also do some farm work . what kind of work ? uh , i will ho ##e <span style="color:red">the field</span> , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , i will help do some work . do you still remember <span style="color:yellow">your mother ' ##s cooking</span> ? uh huh , i do .

[CLS] then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? or go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> with them ? in regard to this , first , , children all want <span style="color:red">their parents</span> to come back to live with them . however , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> with their parents , go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> , to live in <span style="color:red">the city</span> . however , they <span style="color:red">all</span> wanted <span style="color:red">their parents</span> to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> . we also asked them why they did not want to go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> . this was also very surprising to us . they said that <span style="color:red">the city</span> is another world and they were especially worried . they were afraid that once they go to <span style="color:red">the city</span> , they will not be able to ass ##imi ##late into the schools and things like that . second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> . their parents have to send money home , among other things . if they go live with them , they will add more burden ##s to their parents . if <span style="color:red">we</span> are in <span style="color:red">the city</span> every day , live in <span style="color:red">the city</span> every day , <span style="color:red">we</span> may know that oh , city life is like this . as for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear . as for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ? i believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling . <span style="color:red">all parents</span> , i can say <span style="color:yellow">the majority of <span style="color:red">the parents</span></span> , definitely want to live with their children . however , with the reality that they have to face , i believe that they can not solve this problem . of course , we know what the reality is . first , their families are rather poor to begin with . <span style="color:red">only the lower - middle class</span> will leave the rural areas and work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> . they have to make money to support the family . they will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to <span style="color:red">the city</span> . nonetheless , i believe there are also many other reasons .

[CLS] judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non ##- ##le ##ft - behind children ? it is hard to tell from the surface . why is it so ? for these children , it depends on how long <span style="color:red">their parents</span> have been working in <span style="color:red">the city</span> . for example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already . in this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect . however , many schools and cu ##sto ##dian ##s reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn . they had very strange um , um , temperament ##s . they did not like to speak . there was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school . um , um , he told <span style="color:red">us</span> himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father . he was very good at school . however , one time <span style="color:red">we</span> visited him , his um , family told <span style="color:red">us</span> that he was second in his class in his examination . after that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed . um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange . um , um , <span style="color:red">we</span> also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him . they said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him . um , of course , it was not necessarily because <span style="color:red">his parents</span> worked in <span style="color:red">the city</span> . however , for some left - behind children , their parents working in <span style="color:red">the city</span> has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development . this situation indeed exists . after all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete . <span style="color:yellow">i</span> believe love is especially important . children need love from the time they are small . we have to understand <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">our chinese</span> saying , " the child is father to the man</span> . " what it says is that the character that <span style="color:yellow">children</span> form at a very young age will affect their entire life . only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future . this is the case . [SEP]

[CLS] this is the case . therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychological ##ly , they do not have family love . um , , if <span style="color:red">the parents</span> work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home . perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love . under this situation , i believe , i am not sure , um , i am unwilling to imagine what mental ##ity and character these children will develop when they grow up . will they believe there is love in society or not ? will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it . they have never completely experienced it . thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that <span style="color:red">love</span> should be , um , given or received in society , i think this is , something that i do not want to imagine . despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because <span style="color:red">their parents</span> work in <span style="color:red">the city</span> to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require . according to the survey , more than half of <span style="color:red">the left - behind children</span> were dissatisfied with their current life . 58 percent of <span style="color:red">the left - behind children</span> believed that they were unhappy . are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ? do they understand <span style="color:red">the living conditions of their children at home</span> ? they thought that <span style="color:red">this</span> was a reality that they could not um , um , face . they were condemned to <span style="color:red">this reality</span> . no doubt , i think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration . why do n ##' ##t they ? i believe people are all the same . if they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood . they can not consider the deeper issue of children ' ##s safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed . for example , there were <span style="color:yellow">two sisters who lived in <span style="color:yellow">a cave dwelling in sha ##an ##xi province</span></span> .

there are certainly calls for <span style="color:yellow">war against <span style="color:yellow">israel</span></span> . is there much support for <span style="color:yellow">that</span> ? well , actually <span style="color:yellow">president mu ##bara ##k</span> was very cat ##egorical <span style="color:yellow">today</span> in condemning calls for <span style="color:yellow">war</span> , which <span style="color:yellow">he</span> said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what <span style="color:yellow">it</span> meant . <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">egypt</span> and jordan</span> do not want to see any sort of conventional war against <span style="color:yellow">israel</span> . <span style="color:yellow">they</span> have both invested enormous amounts in <span style="color:yellow">it</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">both regimes</span> would be more vulnerable if <span style="color:yellow">the peace process</span> were to fail , because det ##rac ##tors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at <span style="color:yellow">them</span> . how much is <span style="color:yellow">the united states</span> entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from <span style="color:yellow">the united states</span> ? well <span style="color:yellow">today</span> not too much . <span style="color:yellow">i</span> mean <span style="color:yellow">madeleine al ##bright</span> was in <span style="color:yellow">saudi arabia</span> yesterday where <span style="color:yellow">she</span> met with crown prince abdullah and <span style="color:yellow">the new syrian president basha ##r al - ass ##ad</span> . interesting ##ly enough <span style="color:yellow">she</span> is quoted as telling general san ##hol ##i back to <span style="color:yellow">the us</span> that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> did not really get too much of a reception from <span style="color:yellow">basha ##r al - ass ##ad</span> in terms of light ##ening the traditionally antagonist ##ic syrian align towards <span style="color:yellow">israel</span> . nonetheless , <span style="color:yellow">the fact that <span style="color:yellow">she</span> did meet with <span style="color:yellow">basha ##r al - ass ##ad</span> and it was n ##' ##t <span style="color:yellow">saudi arabia which is traditionally being more do ##vish and has supported us policy</span></span> , <span style="color:yellow">it</span> is significant . so , as of <span style="color:yellow">today</span> , <span style="color:yellow">i</span> would say certainly on the surface there has been little us action . well , thank <span style="color:yellow">you</span> very much for the update . <span style="color:yellow">james drummond , correspondent for <span style="color:yellow">the financial times of london</span> speaking to <span style="color:yellow">us</span> from <span style="color:yellow">cairo</span> .</span> thank <span style="color:yellow">you</span> <span style="color:yellow">james</span> . thanks .

" when i went to beijing to negotiate , " recalls ye ##h , " i asked cad ##res in <span style="color:red">the foreign trade office</span> to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry . profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % . how can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ?

[CLS] <span style="color:yellow">the golden age of <span style="color:yellow">hu ##wei</span></span> there are different explanations as to the origins of the word hu ##wei , the original name for tan ##shu ##i . some say it was a translit ##eration of the place name used by the indigenous people . but others say it comes from a long - gone fishing practice , using a shi hu - ##lr ##b ##- " stone pool " - ##rr ##b ##- . early fishermen used stones to car ##ve <span style="color:red">a long , narrow catchment - ##lr ##b ##- the so - called " pool " - ##rr ##b ##-</span> in the sand , waiting for the tide to carry in fish which they could then easily scoop up . since the place now known as tan ##shu ##i was at the tail end - ##lr ##b ##- wei - ##rr ##b ##- of <span style="color:red">this stone pool</span> , it came to be called <span style="color:yellow">hu ##wei</span> . tan ##shu ##i occupied an important place in the transport network connecting taiwan to <span style="color:red">southeast asia</span> . even before the arrival of western ##ers in taiwan , han chinese often crossed over from china to tan ##shu ##i , which is relatively close to the mainland . here they engaged in bart ##er trade with the ping ##pu - ##lr ##b ##- meaning " plains " - ##rr ##b ##- ab ##ori ##gin ##es , with deer skins and sul ##ph ##ur being the most coveted products . as western powers turned their eyes to <span style="color:red">asia</span> , tan ##shu ##i became strategically important . in the 17th century , first the spanish , and then the dutch , built forts here as symbols of their claims to territorial control . in the mid ##- ##17 ##th century , china took control of taiwan , and closed tan ##shu ##i to international trade . later , as a result of the sino - french war of 1884 , tan ##shu ##i was again opened up to western access . during <span style="color:yellow">tan ##shu ##i ' ##s golden age</span> , large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor , and it was not unusual to see enormous steamship ##s . in the latter part of the qing dynasty , tan ##shu ##i was the largest port in taiwan , and was the " customs headquarters , " also charged with overseeing port activities at keel ##ung , tai ##nan , and ka ##oh ##si ##ung . however , during the japanese occupation , as a result of si ##lt ##ing , and because the japanese invested a huge effort in developing the port at keel ##ung , tan ##shu ##i faded in importance , never again to see the likes of its glory days .

[CLS] tips for getting through middle age - ##lr ##b ##- laura li / photos by hs ##ue ##h chi - ku ##ang / tr ##. by jonathan barnard - ##rr ##b ##- middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door . many people peacefully go through it , growing wise ##r and losing their rough edges . a minority do n ##' ##t know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap . middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one ' ##s life , when one ' ##s responsibilities are heaviest . as a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked . middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that ' ##s easiest to overlook . in comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy . even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes chi ##u chi ##a - li , director of the h ##wo ch ##yuan pastoral counseling center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases . social bias <span style="color:yellow">makes</span> many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems . <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings . but by keeping everything inside , they may cause ir ##re ##para ##ble harm to their health . in recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .

[CLS] how do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ? here are a few suggestions : 1 ##. live well at every stage of life li liang - che , a professor of psychology at national cheng ##chi university , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology . he points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age . smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier . in other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life . foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble . is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ? chang der - chung , an associate professor in the department of living science at national open university who worked at a counseling hot ##line for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worth ##while , no matter when you start . middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they ' ##re not hard to avoid . are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ? then no matter how busy you are , you ' ##ve got to set aside some time to be with your spouse . are you worried about losing your job ? then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money . are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ? then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves . there are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start . otherwise , you ' ##ll end up being overwhelmed .

" but now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving <span style="color:red">today ' ##s</span> problems . to assume a posture of superiority based on one ' ##s senior ##ity will make one despised . hence , it is necessary to cast aside one ' ##s old self and start over . chi ##u notes that many middle - aged who have worked dil ##igen ##tly for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for <span style="color:yellow">being</span> reckless and di ##sor ##gan ##ized , but they do n ##' ##t realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath <span style="color:yellow">these flaws</span> . stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history . with each new era , role models change . until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility . for instance , <span style="color:red">today ' ##s</span> middle - aged chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women ' ##s liberation movement . they set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointment ##s are likewise large . many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good home ##makers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers . their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves . then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disc ##ip ##lina ##rians or staying at the same company until they retire . and there are <span style="color:red">women who are determined to play the role of the traditional chinese wife and mother</span> . ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .

making capacity . in announcements to workers late last week , gm effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u ##. ##s ##. car factories . gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became un ##pro ##fi ##table as the giant auto maker ' ##s u ##. ##s ##. market share ski ##dded during the past decade . <span style="color:red">the company , currently using about 80 % of its north american vehicle capacity ,</span> has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . just a month ago , gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in lake ##wood , ga ##. , the eighth u ##. ##s ##. assembly facility to close since 1987 . now , gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u ##. ##s ##. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match . another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no - lay ##off provisions in the new big three national contract that will be <span style="color:yellow">negotiated</span> next year . gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before <span style="color:yellow">those talks</span> begin . the problem , however , is that <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">gm</span> ' ##s</span> moves are coming at <span style="color:yellow">a time when ua ##w leaders are <span style="color:red">trying</span> to silence di ##ssi ##dents who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm lay ##offs</span> . against that backdrop , ua ##w vice president stephen p ##. yo ##kic ##h , who recently became head of <span style="color:red">the <span style="color:yellow">union</span> ' ##s</span> <span style="color:yellow">gm</span> department , issued a statement friday blasting <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">gm</span> ' ##s</span> ` ##` flag ##rant ins ##ens ##iti ##vity ' ##' toward <span style="color:yellow">union</span> members . the auto maker ' ##s decision to let word of the latest shut ##down ##s and product re ##ass ##ignment ##s trickle out in separate com ##mun ##iques to <span style="color:red">the affected plants</span> showed ` ##` di ##sar ##ray ' ##' and an ` ##` inability or unwilling ##ness to provide consistent information , ' ##' mr ##. yo ##kic ##h said . gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves : production of full -

[CLS] of all the ethnic tensions in america , which is the most troubles ##ome right now ? a good bet would be the tension between blacks and jews in <span style="color:yellow">new york city</span> . or so it must seem to <span style="color:yellow">jackie mason , the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new abc sitcom airing on tuesday nights - ##lr ##b ##- 9 ##: ##30 - 10 p ##. ##m ##. ed ##t - ##rr ##b ##-</span> . not only is mr ##. mason the star of ` ##` <span style="color:yellow">chicken soup</span> , ' ##' he ' ##s also the inherit ##or of a comedic tradition dating back to ` ##` duck soup , ' ##' and he ' ##s currently a man in hot water . here , in <span style="color:yellow">neutral language</span> , is the gi ##st of <span style="color:yellow">mr ##. mason ' ##s remarks , quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for <span style="color:yellow">the rudolph gi ##ulia ##ni mayoral campaign</span> , and then in newsweek after he and <span style="color:yellow">the campaign</span> parted company</span> . mr ##. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates un ##cr ##itical ##ly . he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates un ##cr ##itical ##ly . he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa . of course , mr ##. mason did not use <span style="color:yellow">neutral language</span> . as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the bo ##rs ##cht belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , mr ##. mason instinctively reached for the vernacular . he said jews were ` ##` sick with complexes ' ##' ; and he called david din ##kins , mr ##. gi ##ulia ##ni ' ##s black opponent , ` ##` a fancy sh ##var ##tze with a mustache .

' ##' so god will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do . in the scriptures god says to pharaoh : ` ##` i made you king so that you could do this for me . i wanted to show <span style="color:yellow">my power</span> through you . i wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ' ##' so god shows mercy to <span style="color:yellow">those he wants to show mercy to</span> and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn . so <span style="color:red">one of you</span> will ask <span style="color:yellow">me</span> , ` ##` if god controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ' ##' do n ##' ##t ask that . you are only human and have no right to question god . a clay jar does not question the one who made it . it does not say , ` ##` why did you make me like this ? ' ##' the one who makes the jar can make anything he wants . he uses the same clay to make different things . he might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use . it is the same way with what god has done . he wanted to show his anger and to let people see <span style="color:yellow">his power</span> . but he patiently endured those he was angry with - ##- people who were ready to be destroyed . he waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy . god has already prepared them to share his glory . we are <span style="color:yellow">those people , the ones god chose not only from the jews but also from <span style="color:red">those who are not jews</span></span> . as the scriptures say in the book of hose ##a , ` ##` the people who are not mine - ##- i will say they are my people . and the people i did not love - ##- i will say they are the people i love . ' ##' and , ` ##` where god said in the past , ' <span style="color:yellow">you</span> are not my people ' - ##- there they will be called children of the living god . ' ##' [SEP]

[CLS] i am in christ and i am telling <span style="color:yellow">you</span> the truth . i am not lying . and my conscience , ruled by the holy spirit , agrees that what i say now is true . i have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people . they are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family . i wish i could <span style="color:red">help</span> them . i would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from christ if <span style="color:red">that</span> would help them . they are the people of <span style="color:red">israel</span> , god ' ##s chosen children . they have the glory of god and the agreements he made between himself and <span style="color:yellow">his people</span> . god gave them <span style="color:yellow">the law of moses</span> , the temple worship , and his promises . they are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of christ . and christ is god over all things . praise him forever ! am ##en . i do n ##' ##t mean that god failed to keep his promise to the jewish people . but only some of the people of israel are really god ' ##s people . and <span style="color:yellow">only some of abraham ' ##s descendants</span> are true children of abraham . this is what god said to abraham : ` ##` your true descendants will <span style="color:yellow">be</span> <span style="color:yellow">those who come through <span style="color:yellow">isaac</span></span> . ' ##' <span style="color:yellow">this</span> means that not all of <span style="color:yellow">abraham ' ##s descendants</span> are god ' ##s true children . <span style="color:red">abraham ' ##s true children</span> are <span style="color:yellow">those who become god ' ##s children because of the promise he made to abraham</span> . here is what god said in that promise : ` ##` about this time next year i will come back , and <span style="color:red">sarah</span> will have a son . ' ##' and that is not all . rebecca also had <span style="color:yellow">sons</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">they</span> had the same father . he is our father isaac . but before the two sons were born , god told rebecca , ` ##` the older son will serve <span style="color:yellow">the younger</span> . ' ##' this was before the boys had done anything good or bad . god said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of god ' ##s own plan . he was chosen because he was the one god wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did . as the scriptures say , ` ##` i loved <span style="color:yellow">jacob</span> , but i hated <span style="color:yellow">esa ##u</span> .

[CLS] the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth . this place was inside a tent . the first area in the tent was called <span style="color:yellow">the holy place</span> . in the holy place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to god . behind the second curtain was <span style="color:yellow">a room called the most holy place</span> . in the most holy place was a golden altar for burning incense . and also there was the box of <span style="color:red">the agreement</span> . the box was covered with gold . inside this box was a golden jar of mann ##a and aaron ' ##s rod - ##- the rod that once grew leaves . also in the box were the flat stones with <span style="color:yellow">the ten command ##ments of the old agreement</span> on them . above the box were the cher ##ub angels that showed god ' ##s glory . these cher ##ub angels were over the place of mercy . but we can not say everything about this now . everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties . but only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year . also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him . he offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinn ##ing . <span style="color:yellow">the holy spirit</span> uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there . this is an example for us today . it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the conscience ##s of the worship ##ers completely clear . these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washing ##s . they are only rules about the body . god gave <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">them</span> for <span style="color:yellow">his people</span> to follow until the time of his new way</span> . but christ has already come to be the high priest . he is the high priest of the good things we now have . but christ does not serve in a place like the tent that <span style="color:yellow">those other priests</span> served in . he serves in <span style="color:yellow">a better place</span> . unlike that tent , this one is perfect . [SEP]

[CLS] unlike that tent , this one is perfect . it was not made by anyone here on earth . it does not belong to this world . christ entered the most holy place only one time - ##- enough for all time . he entered the most holy place by using <span style="color:yellow">his own blood</span> , not the blood of <span style="color:red">goats or young bulls</span> . he entered there and made us free from sin forever . the blood of <span style="color:red">goats and bulls</span> and the ashes of a cow were sp ##rin ##kled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter <span style="color:red">the place of worship</span> . the blood and ashes made them pure again - ##- but only their bodies . so surely the blood sacrifice of christ can do much more . christ offered himself through <span style="color:yellow">the eternal spirit</span> as a perfect sacrifice to god . his blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done . it will give us clear conscience ##s so that we can worship the living god . so christ brings a new agreement from god to <span style="color:yellow">his people</span> . he brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by god can <span style="color:yellow">have</span> the blessings god promised , blessings that last forever . <span style="color:yellow">this</span> can happen only because christ died to free people from sins committed against <span style="color:yellow">the commands of the first agreement</span> . when someone dies and leaves <span style="color:yellow">a will</span> , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead . a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . it can be used only after that person ' ##s death . that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and <span style="color:yellow">his people</span> . first , moses told the people <span style="color:yellow">every command in the law</span> . then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water . he used red wool and a branch of h ##ys ##sop to sp ##rin ##kle <span style="color:red">the blood and water</span> on the book of the law and on <span style="color:yellow">all the people</span> . then he said , ` ##` this is the blood that makes the agreement good - ##- the agreement that god commanded you to follow . ' ##' in the same way , moses sp ##rin ##kled the blood on <span style="color:yellow">the holy tent</span> . he sp ##rin ##kled the blood over everything used in worship . the law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood .

##- the rod that once grew leaves . also in the box were the flat stones with <span style="color:yellow">the ten command ##ments of the old agreement</span> on them . above the box were the cher ##ub angels that showed god ' ##s glory . these cher ##ub angels were over the place of mercy . but we can not say everything about this now . everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties . but only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year . also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him . he offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinn ##ing . <span style="color:yellow">the holy spirit</span> uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there . this is an example for us today . it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the conscience ##s of the worship ##ers completely clear . these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washing ##s . they are only rules about the body . god gave <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:red">them</span> for <span style="color:yellow">his people</span> to follow until the time of his new way</span> . but christ has already come to be the high priest . he is the high priest of the good things we now have . but christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in . he serves in <span style="color:yellow">a better place</span> . unlike that tent , this one is perfect . it was not made by anyone here on <span style="color:red">earth</span> . it does not belong to <span style="color:red">this world</span> . christ entered the most holy place only one time - ##- enough for all time . he entered the most holy place by using <span style="color:yellow">his own blood</span> , not the blood of <span style="color:red">goats or young bulls</span> . he entered there and made us free from sin forever . <span style="color:yellow">the blood of <span style="color:red">goats and bulls</span> and the ashes of a cow</span> were sp ##rin ##kled on <span style="color:yellow">those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship</span> . <span style="color:yellow">the blood and ashes</span> made <span style="color:yellow">them</span> pure again - ##- but only <span style="color:yellow">their</span> bodies . so surely the blood sacrifice of <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> can do much more . <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> offered <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> through <span style="color:yellow">the eternal spirit</span> as a perfect sacrifice to <span style="color:yellow">god</span> . <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">his</span> blood</span> will make <span style="color:yellow">us</span> completely clean from the evil <span style="color:yellow">we</span> have done . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> will give <span style="color:yellow">us</span> clear conscience ##s so that <span style="color:yellow">we</span> can worship <span style="color:yellow">the living god</span> . so <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> brings <span style="color:yellow">a new agreement from <span style="color:yellow">god</span> to <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">his</span> people</span></span> . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> brings <span style="color:yellow">this agreement</span> so that those who are chosen by <span style="color:yellow">god</span> can <span style="color:yellow">have</span> the blessings <span style="color:yellow">god</span> promised , blessings that last forever . <span style="color:yellow">this</span> can happen only because <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> died to free people from sins committed against <span style="color:yellow">the commands of <span style="color:yellow">the first agreement</span></span> . when <span style="color:yellow">someone</span> dies and leaves <span style="color:yellow">a will</span> , there must be proof that <span style="color:yellow">the one who wrote <span style="color:yellow">the will</span></span> is dead . <span style="color:yellow">a will</span> means nothing while <span style="color:yellow">the one who wrote <span style="color:yellow">it</span></span> is still living . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> can be used only after <span style="color:yellow">that person ' ##s</span> death . that is why blood was needed to begin <span style="color:yellow">the first agreement between <span style="color:yellow">god</span> and <span style="color:yellow"><span style="color:yellow">his</span> people</span></span> . first , <span style="color:yellow">moses</span> told <span style="color:yellow">the people</span> <span style="color:yellow">every command in <span style="color:yellow">the law</span></span> . then <span style="color:yellow">he</span> took <span style="color:yellow">the blood of young bulls</span> and mixed <span style="color:yellow">it</span> with water . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> used red wool and a branch of h ##ys ##sop to sp ##rin ##kle the blood and water on the book of <span style="color:yellow">the law</span> and on <span style="color:yellow">all the people</span> . then <span style="color:yellow">he</span> said , ` ##` <span style="color:yellow">this</span> is the blood that makes <span style="color:yellow">the agreement</span> good - ##- <span style="color:yellow">the agreement that <span style="color:yellow">god</span> commanded <span style="color:yellow">you</span> to follow</span> . ' ##' in the same way , <span style="color:yellow">moses</span> sp ##rin ##kled <span style="color:yellow">the blood</span> on <span style="color:yellow">the holy tent</span> . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> sp ##rin ##kled <span style="color:yellow">the blood</span> over everything used in worship . <span style="color:yellow">the law</span> says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice . <span style="color:yellow">these things</span> are copies of <span style="color:yellow">the real things that are in <span style="color:yellow">heaven</span></span> . <span style="color:yellow">these copies</span> had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . but <span style="color:yellow">the real things in <span style="color:yellow">heaven</span></span> must have much better sacrifices . <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> went into <span style="color:yellow">the most holy place</span> . but <span style="color:yellow">it</span> was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of <span style="color:yellow">the real one</span> . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> went into <span style="color:yellow">heaven</span> , and <span style="color:yellow">he</span> is there now before <span style="color:yellow">god</span> to help <span style="color:yellow">us</span> . <span style="color:yellow">the high priest</span> enters <span style="color:yellow">the most holy place</span> once every year . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> takes with <span style="color:yellow">him</span> blood to offer . but <span style="color:yellow">he</span> does not offer <span style="color:yellow">his</span> own blood like <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> did . <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> went into <span style="color:yellow">heaven</span> , but not to offer <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> many times like <span style="color:yellow">the high priest</span> offers blood again and again . if <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> had offered <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> many times , <span style="color:yellow">he</span> would have needed to suffer many times since the time <span style="color:yellow">the world</span> was made . but <span style="color:yellow">he</span> came to offer <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> only once . and that once is enough for all time . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> came at a time when <span style="color:yellow">the world</span> is nearing an end . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> came to take away all sin by offering <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> as a sacrifice . <span style="color:yellow">everyone</span> must die once . then <span style="color:yellow">they</span> are judged . so <span style="color:yellow">christ</span> was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . and <span style="color:yellow">he</span> will come <span style="color:yellow">a second time</span> , but not to offer <span style="color:yellow">himself</span> for sin . <span style="color:yellow">he</span> will come <span style="color:yellow">the second time</span> to bring salvation to those who are waiting for <span style="color:yellow">him</span> .

[CLS] if there are no price controls and mono ##pol ##ies , <span style="color:red">china ' ##s gas price</span> should n ##' ##t have been this high . i want to say that i think <span style="color:yellow">these two opinions</span> are both correct . so , on the issue of oil consumption , i think china and <span style="color:yellow">the us</span> , the no ##. 1 and no ##. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair . from a global perspective , the us gas price is obviously too low . so man ##ki ##w at harvard even formed a " pig ##ou club , " gathering social celebrities who support levy ##ing higher taxes on gas prices - ##lr ##b ##- here ##by raising gas prices - ##rr ##b ##- . china ' ##s gas prices are more complicated . in fact , gas prices in china are probably not very high , but in order to reduce china ' ##s future over ##de ##pen ##den ##ce on gas , it may be better that china ' ##s gas prices are higher . but , the direct result of the gas price increase in china will be the increase of <span style="color:yellow">monopoly profits of the monopoly companies</span> . <span style="color:yellow">this part of money</span> will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better . in other words , <span style="color:red">the gas price in china</span> is too high in the di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tive sense . <span style="color:red">it</span> is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people . but in terms of sustainability , <span style="color:red">china ' ##s gas price</span> may still be too low . we need high gas prices to control the over ##de ##pen ##den ##ce on energy imports . perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people . if you are a taxi driver , <span style="color:red">my reply</span> is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of <span style="color:yellow">our</span> taxi licensing regulation system . if you are a car owner , <span style="color:red">my reply</span> is : ride the subway and bus more often . it saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable .

for example , the highway maintenance fee in china is paid separately . just now , i only narrated <span style="color:yellow">a fact</span> . but i believe that different persons see different problems in <span style="color:yellow">this fact</span> . let me describe <span style="color:yellow">people ' ##s two reactions that i can imagine</span> , or the two problems i can see . 1 ##. <span style="color:red">the us gas price</span> is too cheap . in an absolute sense , <span style="color:red">the us gas price</span> has + ##al ##rea ##dy been cheaper than china ' ##s , and in a relative sense , <span style="color:red">the us gas price</span> is even cheaper . in the us , the money you pay for a meal at <span style="color:yellow">mcdonald ' ##s</span> can fill up more than 10 liter ##s of gas , but in beijing you can get 5 - 6 liter ##s of gas at most . the us low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country ' ##s excessive use of and over ##de ##pen ##den ##ce on energy resources . however , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by <span style="color:red">the us</span> excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc ##. it is totally a joke that <span style="color:red">the us gas price</span> could be cheaper than china ' ##s . 2 ##. <span style="color:red">china ' ##s gas price</span> is too expensive . both americans and chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil ref ##ine ##ment are not too much different . but with <span style="color:red">the us gas price</span> including taxes even lower than <span style="color:red">china ' ##s gas price</span> excluding taxes , you can see how much money chinese oil companies have made out of this . if there are no price controls and mono ##pol ##ies , <span style="color:red">china ' ##s gas price</span> should n ##' ##t have been this high . i want to say that i think <span style="color:yellow">these two opinions</span> are both correct . so , on the issue of oil consumption , i think china and <span style="color:yellow">the us</span> , the no ##. 1 and no ##. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair . from a global perspective , the us gas price is obviously too low . so man ##ki ##w at harvard even formed a " pig ##ou club , " gathering social celebrities who support levy ##ing higher taxes on gas prices - ##lr ##b ##- here ##by raising gas prices - ##rr ##b ##- . <span style="color:yellow">china ' ##s</span> gas prices are more complicated . in fact , gas prices in <span style="color:yellow">china</span> are probably not very high , but in order to reduce <span style="color:yellow">china ' ##s</span> future over ##de ##pen ##den ##ce on gas , it may be better that <span style="color:yellow">china ' ##s</span> gas prices are higher . but , the direct result of the gas price increase in <span style="color:yellow">china</span> will be the increase of <span style="color:yellow">monopoly profits of the monopoly companies</span> . <span style="color:yellow">this part of money</span> will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better . in other words , the gas price in <span style="color:yellow">china</span> is too high in the di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tive sense . it is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people . but in terms of sustainability , <span style="color:yellow">china ' ##s</span> gas price may still be too low . we need high gas prices to control the over ##de ##pen ##den ##ce on energy imports . perhaps someone will condemn <span style="color:yellow">me</span> , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people . if you are a taxi driver , <span style="color:yellow">my</span> reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of <span style="color:yellow">our</span> taxi licensing regulation system . if you are a car owner , <span style="color:yellow">my</span> reply is : <span style="color:yellow">ride</span> the subway and bus more often . <span style="color:yellow">it</span> saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . " compared with most people , your life is already quite good . darling ##0 ##8 ##23 comparing <span style="color:yellow">mcdonald ' ##s</span> in <span style="color:yellow">the us</span> with <span style="color:yellow">mcdonald ' ##s</span> in <span style="color:yellow">china</span> may not be right . eating a meal at <span style="color:yellow">mcdonald ' ##s</span> in <span style="color:yellow">the us</span> is more comparable to buying a 5 - yuan boxed meal in <span style="color:yellow">china</span> .
